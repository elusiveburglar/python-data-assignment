       "'[ “Utterly messed up my life”: What Chinese people really think of the trade war        The Guardian By Echo HuangOctober 9  2018        China’s ardent determination to win the trade war might not have all the public support it would like.        Since the US and China entered a trade war in earnest this year  both sides have been going tit-for-tat with increasing tariffs on goods. The US has put new tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports  while China has done the same to $110 billion worth of US goods. And while China’s running out of US goods to keep the retaliation going  its strongest weapon in this “war of national fate” with the US is the spirit of the Chinese people  according to state media.       \"“The heroism of ‘being the first to show concern and the last to enjoy oneself’ has always run through Chinese blood  which also includes the spirit of ‘sacrificing one’s interest for the greater good of the public  ” said an opinion piece (link in Chinese) posted by the state-run People’s Daily on July 10. “Facing this ‘war of national fate ’ Chinese are deeply aware that ‘there’s no home without a country ’ so they are willing to bear temporary losses.”\"       That comment doesn’t acknowledge how painful the trade war could become for common people. Economists estimate that if the latest Chinese goods to be added to the trade war see tariffs go up to 25% next year  it could shave half a percentage point off China’s growth. Online  people are sharing how they’re experiencing the impacts so far  and worrying about what’s to come.        Stocks tumble  yuan devalues    On Monday (Oct.7)  the first day after the Golden Week holiday  Chinese stocks fell sharply. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.7%—its biggest single-day loss (paywall)  in more than three months. The stock tumble came a day after China’s central bank announced that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks for the fourth time this year—a move seen as trying to boost the economy by increasing liquidity amid the trade war. In general  China’s stock markets haven’t been (paywall) taking the trade war in stride.        “This has been a tough year for me. I haven’t received payments on several projects because of stock bursts ” wrote a user (link in Chinese) of social media platform Weibo  who identified himself as working at a securities firm in Beijing. “The stock market’s tumble and the trade war have killed many projects. When I returned home  the village officials asked me how’s my work so far this year. My answer  sadly  was this—deleveraging  bad stock performance  and the trade war have utterly messed up my life.”        REUTERS/MARIANA BAZO    Looking for new markets.    The devalued yuan has also worried many. While it could help exporters by making their goods more competitive  it makes life tougher for people who need foreign currency  for example families of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese studying abroad.        “We are now kneeling to the trade war. It’s hard to see that the RMB [renminbi] can be stable in the near term. Looks like the Great Depression is going to arrive ” said a Weibo comment (link in Chinese).        Snacks  oil prices up    Treats are suddenly more expensive due to tariffs  and so are daily necessities.        “I ran out of nuts yesterday and wanted to top up my stock ” wrote a female user (link in Chinese) based in northern Hebei province  but she found the nuts she’s used to eating every day  including pecans  commonly sourced from the US  cost her more.        “I asked the shop owner  ‘Why is it more expensive than last time?’ The owner said it’s because of the trade war ” she continued  “And I asked him  ‘What’s the relationship?’ He said that he had imported lots of the nuts from overseas. This is the first time I feel the impact of the trade war.”        As for Maine lobster  forget about it.        Chinese drivers are also feeling the pinch  with China putting tariffs on US oil imports in August.        “I’ve deeply felt that the economic environment is not good. This year  there’s peer-to-peer lending and illegal money-raising crackdown  which also bled out a bunch of people. Now the drop has come to the real estate market…. then there’s the trade war  and oil prices keep going up. It won’t be long before I can’t afford to run my car ” wrote a user (link in Chinese).        Small businesses may be harder hit than larger ones. The most recent Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index  a better gauge of sentiment at smaller  private firms than the official manufacturing PMI  declined from 50.6 in August to 50 last month  the lowest level in more than a year. A number below 50 indicates a contraction.        REUTERS    In response to US tariffs  China has put tariffs on American soybean imports.    Pessimism about the new NAFTA    People aren’t optimistic the pressure on China’s economy will ease up. In fact  the new North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiated by the US  Mexico  and Canada—now with a brand-new acronym—shows the formation of a front against China  some online commenters noted.        “Why is the Chinese economy going to be difficult in the next six months?” wrote a male user (link in Chinese) of micro-blogging site Weibo  based in China’s southwestern Sichuan province. His argument that the elements that have been key to driving China’s economic growth in recent years—including infrastructure  foreign trade  and domestic demands—have all shown worrying signs.         “In terms of foreign trade  this is the most worrying ” he wrote. “The Americans are launching trade wars worldwide because they want to bypass the WTO [World Trade Organization] and build something new. At the end of September  the US  Canada and Mexico signed a new cooperation agreement. The agreement said if a ‘non-market-oriented economy‘ wants to enter their market  it needs the approval of all the three countries… Everyone knows who this ‘non-market-oriented economy’ is.”        (The new NAFTA asks countries in the agreement to notify each other if they are to have trade deal talks with a “non-market” economy  and also give one another a say in the deal.)        “Americans have been building an anti-China circle. In the first round  the Mexico gave in  then Canada. I am afraid that the third round is Japan  then Europe ” said another (link in Chinese). “I highly suggest that China should make major adjustments to its current policies instead of listening to the opinions from so-called elites.”China won’t back down in trade war with US: commerce minister        SCMP Amanda Lee        China will not cave in to US demands even if it faces further tariffs on its exports  China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan has said  signalling Beijing’s uncompromising stance in dealing with US.        “There is a view in the US that so long as the US keeps increasing tariffs  China will back down. They don’t know the history and culture of China ” Zhong said  in a statement published by Bloomberg News.        “This unyielding nation suffered foreign bullying for many times in history  but never succumbed to it even in the most difficult conditions. China doesn’t want a trade war  but would rise up to it should it break out.        “The US should not underestimate China’s resolve and will.”            This is Beijing’s strongest response yet to the trade war following a release of a white paper last month detailing its stance on the trade war  in which China blamed the US for creating the tensions and painted itself as a promoter of free trade.        The strong comments from Zhong  whose ministry is in the front line of any possible talks with the US  coincide with a rapid deterioration in the ties between Beijing and Washington.        Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage ofCHINA’S COMMERCE MINISTER ZHONG SHAN    US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  on a brief visit to Beijing on Monday  had a testy exchange with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.        Wang told Pompeo the US had hurt “mutual trust” and must stop “misguided actions” against China  while Pompeo said there were “fundamental disagreements” between the two powers.        Prospects for Beijing and Washington to de-escalate their trade tensions are not bright.        The two sides have locked horns in levying punitive tariffs against each other and there are gaping differences over a slew of issues from intellectual property rights to the role of state-owned enterprises.            The US initially imposed a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion worth of Chinese imports  and in September added a 10 per cent tariff on an additional US$200 billion of Chinese products  with the tariff rate set to rise to 25 per cent on January 1 if China does not make trade concessions.        China’s central bank to pump US$110 billion into economy as US trade war intensifies    US President Donald Trump has also threatened to extend punitive tariffs to all Chinese imports.        China retaliated with a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion of US imports and variable tariffs of 5 per cent to 10 per cent on a further US$60 billion of US imports.        China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi (left) and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a testy exchange on Monday in Beijing. Photo: AP    Washington is demanding China change its trade practices of forcing US businesses to transfer technologies and of subsidising state-owned enterprises.        Zhong reiterated Beijing’s line that China does not steal technology from US firms.        “I want to emphasise that China’s laws and regulations do not contain any requirement for technology transfer and that companies’ purchases of technologies and patents are pure market behaviour ” he said.        “China’s economic development  and science and technological progress are owed to reform and opening up and the endeavours of the Chinese people.”        As US turns up heat on China  trade war moves beyond tariffs to new battlefronts    Zhong also argued that China never “took advantage of the US” even as the country ran a record trade surplus of US$31.05 billion with the US in August.        “If one side had been taken advantage of all the time  could such business relations have continued? Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage of ” Zhong said.        The conflict between the two countries has now gone beyond trade  with Trump’s accusations that China is attempting to interfere in the 2018 US midterm congressional elections. Vice-President Mike Pence also stepped up the attack by condemning Beijing for using “every tool at its disposal” to undermine the US political system.        Pence also warned American companies  including tech giant Alphabet  which owns Google  to disengage from China.Trump rips up the trade playbook to take on China        Donna Borak  CNN        Updated 1037 GMT (1837 HKT) October 9  2018        Bali  Indonesia (CNN)President Donald Trump wants a deal with China — just not anytime soon.        After announcing a revamped trade agreement with Canada and Mexico last week  Trump reeled off a list of other countries that he said had given in to US demands to hold talks or make a deal: South Korea  Japan  the European Union.    He scoffed at those \"babies out there\" who worried about the effects of tariffs  suggesting that \"we wouldn\\\\ t be talking about a deal\" with Canada and Mexico without his confrontational approach.    The trade war will hit US and Chinese growth next year  the IMF warns    \"That\\\\ s going to embolden him to impose more tariffs and threaten more in the hopes of getting a better deal out of China \" said Edward Alden  a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.   \"Trump s no-holds-barred strategy on China is likely take center stage this week at a summit of global finance chiefs and central bankers in Bali  Indonesia. And it ll be up to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  the president s top economic envoy  to argue the US case as warnings intensify about the damage a protracted trade war could do to global economic growth.\"   \"The stakes are high \" Christine Lagarde  the managing director of the International Monetary Fund  said last week. \"We need to work together to de-escalate and resolve the current trade disputes.\"   \" Coalition of the willing \"  \"If the Trump administration can get the European Union and Japan on side following the recent trade deals with South Korea  Canada and Mexico  that s likely to strengthen the US negotiating position with Beijing  top administration officials argue.\"   US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA        US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA 01:58    \"We are talking to the European Union again  we are talking to Japan again  and we are moving to what I have characterized as a trade coalition of the willing to confront China \" Larry Kudlow  Trump\\\\ s chief economic adviser  said last week.   \"But talks with Europe and Japan are still in the early stages. And French President Emmanuel Macron said last month that Europe shouldn t sign trade deals with any country that doesn t comply with the Paris Agreement on climate change  a clear reference to the United States.\"  \"The Trump administration s approach to building a coalition against Beijing is a break from the old playbook of working collaboratively with allies to address mutual concerns.\"   Other big economies like the European Union and Japan share some of the main US grievances with China  including intellectual property theft and pressure on foreign companies to hand over technology to Chinese partners. But Trump slapped tariffs on key allies at the same time as stepping up his campaign against China  which some analysts suggest has weakened any potential united front.    The Trump administration has imposed new tariffs on about half of China&#39;s annual goods exports to the United States.    Souring relationship   \"Trump has made clear he s in no rush to restart talks with Beijing anytime soon. Instead  he has threatened to impose an even bigger wave of tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese products. That would mean the US measures effectively cover all the goods China sells to the United States each year.\"   \"I\\\\ m using them to negotiate \" Trump said of the tariffs. \"And hopefully  we can make a great deal with China — a fair deal and a reciprocal deal.\"    Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Details of the revised pact with Canada and Mexico  which is set to replace NAFTA  show that the US government is also trying other ways to amplify the pressure on China.    Tucked in the new agreement is a requirement that each country inform the others if it wants to start free trade negotiations with a \"non-market economy \" a clear reference to China. The other countries would also be able to review any potential free trade deal with China.    That move has upset Beijing  further souring the relationship between the two economic superpowers.    In a frank exchange of views in Beijing on Monday  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the United States should immediately stop its \"wrong remarks and actions \" including the trade war. Pompeo responded that the two countries have a \"fundamental disagreement\" and that the United States has \"great concerns about actions that China has taken.\"   \" How much pain are they willing to endure? \"   Neither side is showing signs of backing down.   \"The United States  whose economy relies less on exports than China s  is faring better so far. China s economy had already started slowing down this year and its stock markets and currency have slumped as the trade conflict has escalated.\"   China is pumping more cash into its economy as the trade war heats up    \"The question is: How much pain are they willing to endure?\" said Thomas Bernes  a distinguished fellow for the Centre for International Governance Innovation. \"They will be looking to the midterm elections to see if there is going to be a rejection of Trumpism or whether they he gains strength and remains in power.\"    For its part  the Trump administration appears willing to maintain the pressure for as long as it can.    \"We have changed the paradigm \" US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said last month. \"We have tariffs in place  and the president is not going to let this go along when you have forced transfer of intellectual property.\"    Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires at the end of November.    But with Beijing unwilling to give ground on US demands that it change fundamental parts of its economic policy  the prospects of reaching a deal anytime soon appear slim.    \"It is still hard to see how a further escalation of the trade conflict with China will be avoided \" Andrew Hunter  US economist at research firm Capital Economics said in a note to clients last week.Is China or Russia America’s Defining Rival?    The debate doesn’t just have consequences for U.S. foreign policy—it will define the next decades of domestic affairs as well.        OCT 9  2018        Late last week  as most of America’s political class was transfixed by the denouement of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle  Vice President Mike Pence gave a wide-ranging address on the U.S. relationship with China  and why the Trump administration is committed to opposing its expansionist designs. For the most part  it was a familiar litany of complaints about China’s efforts to coerce its neighbors in the western Pacific  its trade abuses  its hostility to religious freedom  and its support of unsavory regimes around the world. Yet halfway through his remarks  the vice president shifted his emphasis  turning from all the various ways the Chinese party-state was acting in the world outside America’s borders to how it was seeking to influence political and cultural life inside them.        Specifically  Pence warned that “China wants a different American president ” and that Beijing was mobilizing “covert actors  front groups  and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policies” to that end. By now  it has become routine for the heads of U.S. multinationals to condemn the Trump administration’s trade policies  and the fact that they’d do so is perfectly understandable. China’s violent labor repression and its policy of subsidizing industrialists at the expense of households have proved highly advantageous to those seeking a disciplined and relatively low-cost workforce  regardless of their citizenship. According to Pence  however  there is another layer to the politics of trade  namely that senior Chinese officials are threatening to punish business leaders who fail to denounce U.S. tariffs. He pointed to the rising sophistication with which Beijing exploits America’s domestic political cleavages  as evidenced by its targeting of retaliatory tariffs to regions and industries believed crucial to the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections  and its shrewd efforts to silence criticism of Chinese policies on university campuses desperate for Chinese money.

Some observers have dismissed the idea  warning that it represents a distraction from ongoing Russian meddling. Others acknowledge that while China’s efforts to influence democratic outcomes are different in character from Russia’s approach  which Beijing seems to see as “ineffective and counterproductive ” there is no question that  as Rush Doshi and Robert D. Williams of the Brookings Institution have cautiously observed  “China has long pursued a wide-ranging and very real campaign to influence the political and informational environment of other countries  including the United States.”        Needless to say  one could see both Russia and China as dangerous rivals  and I certainly do. But in an age of intensifying partisan enmity  when large numbers of Americans question the legitimacy of the Trump presidency while similarly large numbers see Donald Trump as their champion  it is fitting that Democrats and Republicans can’t bring themselves to agree on which of the world’s revanchist powers ought to serve as what you might call our orienting enemy or  as the Harvard political scientist Samuel P. Huntington once put it  the “other” that gives our grand strategy its ideological shape.        In 1997  not long after the collapse of the Soviet bloc  Huntington warned that American grand strategy was losing its coherence in part because America’s creedal identity had long been defined in opposition to just such an “other.” In the early days of the republic  he observed  it was Britain that offered this necessary contrast: While the British lived under tyranny and hierarchy  Americans told themselves  we enjoyed freedom and equality. So  too  in later years did Wilhelmine Germany provide an orienting rivalry  and then the Nazi and Soviet totalitarianisms that ravaged the world for much of the 20th century. The Soviet Union’s demise therefore prompted a kind of identity crisis. “While wars at times may have a divisive effect on society ” wrote Huntington  “a common enemy can often help to promote identity and cohesion among people. The weakening or absence of a common enemy can do just the reverse.”        What Huntington did not quite anticipate is that America would find itself divided between two creedal identities—one right  one left—each of which defines itself against a different enemy. This is a pattern that has obtained in earlier eras. Consider that the founding generation was bitterly divided over whether Revolutionary France or the British Empire represented the greater threat to American liberty. The early 1900s saw debates between Germanophiles  many of whom were progressives and socialists of German extraction  and Anglophiles who embraced the idea of a world order jointly administered by a British-American condominium. The difference now is that even in the supposed twilight of American global leadership  our creedal clashes reverberate around the world.        And so the United States finds itself in the midst of not one but two cold wars. To cosmopolitan liberals  it is Russia that serves as America’s chief geopolitical adversary. Even in Russia’s weakened and impoverished state  they fear the deftness with which its operatives act in connivance with illiberal elements in the world’s diverse market democracies to undermine them from within. Nationalist conservatives see rising Chinese power as the far graver threat to American interests  and they are increasingly open to wielding the power of the state to resist and counter Beijing’s depredations  despite the cost to economic freedom that may well result.        It is not difficult to understand why Russia has such a hold on the liberal imagination. There is at this point little doubt that the Russian state has sought to sow chaos and division in the U.S. and democratic Europe  in part out of a conviction that Western liberals have done much the same throughout post-Soviet Eurasia. Though the extent to which Russian information operations influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election is contested  the notion that it played a decisive role is an article of faith among Trump’s liberal critics  for whom Vladimir Putin is the perfect foil.        The Putin ascendancy has been defined by  in the first place  rank kleptocracy  but also by an explicit and often deranged antiliberalism  in which the chief enemies of the Russian nation are the forces of gay rights and feminism. As the American author Timothy Snyder has argued  Putinism’s crusade against gay rights was designed “to transform demands for democracy into a nebulous threat to Russian innocence: voting = west = sodomy.” While defining liberalism as the politics of sexual perversion  Putin defines his own regime as the defender of masculinity and traditionalism  and as the natural ally of all those who defend state sovereignty against the supposed cosmopolitan conspiracy to dissolve the natural family. In short  Putin invites cosmopolitan liberals to see Russia under his rule as their enemy  just as he invites right-wing populists in the Western democracies to see him as a friend.        An America that defines itself against Putin’s Russia is an America that would redouble its commitment to cosmopolitan liberalism  including a commitment to free and open trade on a multilateral  nondiscriminatory basis  while marginalizing nationalist conservatism as retrograde. nato would be shored up  which is all to the good  but the U.S. would adopt a warier attitude toward populist parties in Central and Eastern Europe  a stance that could see these democracies drift further out of the American orbit.        And as for the Chinese party-state  it wouldn’t exactly be a friend  especially in light of its hostility to civil liberties  but the Chinese Communist Party’s stated commitment to combating climate change and antitrade nationalist politicians would lend it a certain prestige and legitimacy. Shortly after Trump’s inauguration  Xi Jinping presented himself as a defender of a rules-based international order  the Paris agreement  and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran  and in doing so he won himself admirers in elite circles  especially among those unaware of the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims for political crimes. Over time  a U.S. grand strategy rooted in cosmopolitan liberalism might grow warier of Chinese power  especially if the Chinese party-state were to become more explicitly nationalist as it sees less of a need to cater to cosmopolitan-liberal sensibilities  as seems likely. But by then the economic integration of the Western democracies with China might be irreversible  and Beijing would have the upper hand.        What would it mean for the U.S. to instead choose China as its “other ” as nationalist conservatives would have it? One early indication comes from a recent report from the Department of Defense  which details America’s growing dependence on China’s manufacturing base  and the threat this poses to the country’s war-fighting capabilities. In the 1990s and 2000s  market conservatives could point to the Soviet collapse as an indictment of statism  and to global economic integration as an unambiguous good. Many of these market conservatives now find themselves making common cause with cosmopolitan liberals while nationalist conservatives rethink their commitment to laissez-faire  with an eye toward meeting the challenge posed by a Chinese party-state that sees industrial progress as central to its strategic ambitions. If Beijing  not Moscow  is public enemy No. 1  it is vital that the U.S. boost public investment in infrastructure and human capital  and that it steer U.S. firms to build resilient supply chains based in the Americas  not in China’s industrial heartland. Russia would still be a rival  I suspect  but it would be seen through a different lens: as a potential ally in the protracted conflict with China  as would become much clearer once Putin himself exits the scene.        Culturally  choosing China as an orienting enemy would have more ambiguous effects. One can imagine a xenophobic turn against Chinese immigrants  visitors  and students  which would have ugly consequences. Yet one can also imagine an embrace of the Chinese people on the grounds that Beijing’s authoritarianism serves a narrow elite more than it serves ordinary workers. The argument  in essence  would be that the U.S. stands against the party-state  not China as a whole  and that America would welcome a more just and inclusive Chinese government. Indeed  Pence made exactly this argument in his recent address. More broadly  an America waging a cold war on China might place a somewhat greater emphasis on cohesion and solidarity over cosmopolitanism  not least because disentangling the American and Chinese economies would entail considerable sacrifice on the part of the U.S. business elite—a sacrifice that would have to be justified in solidaristic terms.        Which enemy will we choose in the years to come? Which cold war will we wage most assiduously? The answer will depend in no small part on the outcome of the elections to come. If history is any guide  the stakes are high  and the consequences will be enduring.Chinese Media Vow to Fight Against ‘Insult’ from Pence  Threaten ‘Cold War’        8 Oct 2018        China’s state-run Global Times vowed over the weekend to fight back against “insults” from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and promised a “new Cold War” if the Trump administration forces the issue by continuing to produce “hostile reports and speeches.”    The Global Times took a passive-aggressive approach in an editorial on Sunday  beginning with strong criticism of Pence’s speech at the Hudson Institute last Thursday and citing observers who compared it to Sir Winston Churchill’s “Iron Curtain” speech about the Soviet Union at the dawn of the Cold War.        The editorial soon mellowed into a reflection on high points of the relationship between America and China  such as U.S. President Richard Nixon’s opening to China  and even took some credit for helping President Ronald Reagan put the Soviet Union out of business.        The Global Times then reiterated Beijing’s standard line about how soft  democratic America stands no chance against authoritarian China in a trade war and positioned Beijing as the more mature player in a conflict Washington has not yet realized it cannot win:        The US  in fact  has limited leverage to contain China. A trade war will inevitably damage the US and is a stupid choice. It’s unrealistic to establish a NATO-style organization to target China. It is impossible to isolate and contain China given its expanding business overseas and domestic markets.        It’s difficult for the White House and Congress to mobilize an anti-China campaign in US society. Gone are the days when the public was willing to take a plunge for the so-called national interest. As long as China keeps calm in the face of hysterical US political elites  the so-called Cold War will not take shape.        At such a time  China should play tai chi with the US. This is the unique strategic wisdom of the Chinese nation. We must make the US feel the pain of the trade war and not allow the US to act unscrupulously in the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits. But we must act in a calm way. China will continue to open up. A deteriorating outside world will not change that.        China is not the Soviet Union. The US cannot deal with China as it did with the Soviet Union.        That last line became a Chinese political mantra with blinding speed after Pence’s speech to the Hudson Institute was compared to Churchill’s Iron Curtain speech.        On Monday  the Global Times pronounced China hurt and confused by the “stinging” speech Pence delivered to the Hudson Institute  filled with accusations that were “vitriolic  ruthless  and delivered in terms considered far from decorous.”        This second editorial invoked the “Thucydides Trap ” which has become another common talking point for Chinese politicians. The Thucydides Trap is a theory that posits ruling powers almost always go to war with rising powers  usually to the regret of both nations  unless extraordinary efforts are made to avoid conflict.        Beijing’s interpretation of Thucydides is that America has a unique responsibility to welcome China as a new global superpower and refrain from protecting American dominance by attempting to “contain” China.        As far as the Chinese are concerned  they are already doing everything a rising power could possibly do to ameliorate the concerns of the aging world hegemon  and they cannot understand why the Trump administration suddenly decided to make a “U-turn” at the urging of “hardliners” and commence efforts to contain China.        The Global Times defended the ad China took out in the Des Moines Register in September  widely seen as a major reason for the Trump administration’s complaint about Chinese interference in U.S. elections.        “Where is the U.S.’ long-hailed freedom of the press?” a state-run newspaper from one of the world’s most aggressive authoritarian regimes risibly asked. In a similar vein  the Global Times portrayed China as merely seeking to defend itself from a “U.S.-initiated trade war ” as if China has not been manipulating markets and stealing technology for decades.        The Global Times concluded President Trump is beating up on China to goose Republican turnout for the midterm elections and distract from “the Russiagate scandal”:        The reason that the Trump administration deliberately chose this timing – when China-US trade tensions are ratcheting up – to deliver the inflammatory speech is the upcoming US midterm elections.        Trump knows that playing the China card is always the safest option. It cannot only divert domestic attention from the Russiagate scandal and shift the political pressure from the president but also incite ordinary voters.        These unfounded accusations show that the understanding and judgment of the Trump administration on Sino-US relations are unprofessional  shallow and indiscreet  which is most worrying. The worsening atmosphere toward China in the US not only affects American public’ opinion on the country but also endangers the safety and interests of Chinese in the US.        When the leader of a state accuses other countries at will  how can he justify his reputation to improve bilateral ties? Perhaps the Trump government needs to think about how to show respect to China before requesting China to respect the US.        The Chinese appear to know the American left is very receptive to theories that President Trump relies on populist appeals to xenophobia and is desperate to distract from the investigation into “Russian collusion” in the 2016 election.“Utterly messed up my life”: What Chinese people really think of the trade war        The Guardian By Echo HuangOctober 9  2018        China’s ardent determination to win the trade war might not have all the public support it would like.        Since the US and China entered a trade war in earnest this year  both sides have been going tit-for-tat with increasing tariffs on goods. The US has put new tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports  while China has done the same to $110 billion worth of US goods. And while China’s running out of US goods to keep the retaliation going  its strongest weapon in this “war of national fate” with the US is the spirit of the Chinese people  according to state media.       \"“The heroism of ‘being the first to show concern and the last to enjoy oneself’ has always run through Chinese blood  which also includes the spirit of ‘sacrificing one’s interest for the greater good of the public  ” said an opinion piece (link in Chinese) posted by the state-run People’s Daily on July 10. “Facing this ‘war of national fate ’ Chinese are deeply aware that ‘there’s no home without a country ’ so they are willing to bear temporary losses.”\"       That comment doesn’t acknowledge how painful the trade war could become for common people. Economists estimate that if the latest Chinese goods to be added to the trade war see tariffs go up to 25% next year  it could shave half a percentage point off China’s growth. Online  people are sharing how they’re experiencing the impacts so far  and worrying about what’s to come.        Stocks tumble  yuan devalues    On Monday (Oct.7)  the first day after the Golden Week holiday  Chinese stocks fell sharply. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.7%—its biggest single-day loss (paywall)  in more than three months. The stock tumble came a day after China’s central bank announced that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks for the fourth time this year—a move seen as trying to boost the economy by increasing liquidity amid the trade war. In general  China’s stock markets haven’t been (paywall) taking the trade war in stride.        “This has been a tough year for me. I haven’t received payments on several projects because of stock bursts ” wrote a user (link in Chinese) of social media platform Weibo  who identified himself as working at a securities firm in Beijing. “The stock market’s tumble and the trade war have killed many projects. When I returned home  the village officials asked me how’s my work so far this year. My answer  sadly  was this—deleveraging  bad stock performance  and the trade war have utterly messed up my life.”        REUTERS/MARIANA BAZO    Looking for new markets.    The devalued yuan has also worried many. While it could help exporters by making their goods more competitive  it makes life tougher for people who need foreign currency  for example families of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese studying abroad.        “We are now kneeling to the trade war. It’s hard to see that the RMB [renminbi] can be stable in the near term. Looks like the Great Depression is going to arrive ” said a Weibo comment (link in Chinese).        Snacks  oil prices up    Treats are suddenly more expensive due to tariffs  and so are daily necessities.        “I ran out of nuts yesterday and wanted to top up my stock ” wrote a female user (link in Chinese) based in northern Hebei province  but she found the nuts she’s used to eating every day  including pecans  commonly sourced from the US  cost her more.        “I asked the shop owner  ‘Why is it more expensive than last time?’ The owner said it’s because of the trade war ” she continued  “And I asked him  ‘What’s the relationship?’ He said that he had imported lots of the nuts from overseas. This is the first time I feel the impact of the trade war.”        As for Maine lobster  forget about it.        Chinese drivers are also feeling the pinch  with China putting tariffs on US oil imports in August.        “I’ve deeply felt that the economic environment is not good. This year  there’s peer-to-peer lending and illegal money-raising crackdown  which also bled out a bunch of people. Now the drop has come to the real estate market…. then there’s the trade war  and oil prices keep going up. It won’t be long before I can’t afford to run my car ” wrote a user (link in Chinese).        Small businesses may be harder hit than larger ones. The most recent Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index  a better gauge of sentiment at smaller  private firms than the official manufacturing PMI  declined from 50.6 in August to 50 last month  the lowest level in more than a year. A number below 50 indicates a contraction.        REUTERS    In response to US tariffs  China has put tariffs on American soybean imports.    Pessimism about the new NAFTA    People aren’t optimistic the pressure on China’s economy will ease up. In fact  the new North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiated by the US  Mexico  and Canada—now with a brand-new acronym—shows the formation of a front against China  some online commenters noted.        “Why is the Chinese economy going to be difficult in the next six months?” wrote a male user (link in Chinese) of micro-blogging site Weibo  based in China’s southwestern Sichuan province. His argument that the elements that have been key to driving China’s economic growth in recent years—including infrastructure  foreign trade  and domestic demands—have all shown worrying signs.         “In terms of foreign trade  this is the most worrying ” he wrote. “The Americans are launching trade wars worldwide because they want to bypass the WTO [World Trade Organization] and build something new. At the end of September  the US  Canada and Mexico signed a new cooperation agreement. The agreement said if a ‘non-market-oriented economy‘ wants to enter their market  it needs the approval of all the three countries… Everyone knows who this ‘non-market-oriented economy’ is.”        (The new NAFTA asks countries in the agreement to notify each other if they are to have trade deal talks with a “non-market” economy  and also give one another a say in the deal.)        “Americans have been building an anti-China circle. In the first round  the Mexico gave in  then Canada. I am afraid that the third round is Japan  then Europe ” said another (link in Chinese). “I highly suggest that China should make major adjustments to its current policies instead of listening to the opinions from so-called elites.”China won’t back down in trade war with US: commerce minister        SCMP Amanda Lee        China will not cave in to US demands even if it faces further tariffs on its exports  China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan has said  signalling Beijing’s uncompromising stance in dealing with US.        “There is a view in the US that so long as the US keeps increasing tariffs  China will back down. They don’t know the history and culture of China ” Zhong said  in a statement published by Bloomberg News.        “This unyielding nation suffered foreign bullying for many times in history  but never succumbed to it even in the most difficult conditions. China doesn’t want a trade war  but would rise up to it should it break out.        “The US should not underestimate China’s resolve and will.”            This is Beijing’s strongest response yet to the trade war following a release of a white paper last month detailing its stance on the trade war  in which China blamed the US for creating the tensions and painted itself as a promoter of free trade.        The strong comments from Zhong  whose ministry is in the front line of any possible talks with the US  coincide with a rapid deterioration in the ties between Beijing and Washington.        Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage ofCHINA’S COMMERCE MINISTER ZHONG SHAN    US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  on a brief visit to Beijing on Monday  had a testy exchange with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.        Wang told Pompeo the US had hurt “mutual trust” and must stop “misguided actions” against China  while Pompeo said there were “fundamental disagreements” between the two powers.        Prospects for Beijing and Washington to de-escalate their trade tensions are not bright.        The two sides have locked horns in levying punitive tariffs against each other and there are gaping differences over a slew of issues from intellectual property rights to the role of state-owned enterprises.            The US initially imposed a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion worth of Chinese imports  and in September added a 10 per cent tariff on an additional US$200 billion of Chinese products  with the tariff rate set to rise to 25 per cent on January 1 if China does not make trade concessions.        China’s central bank to pump US$110 billion into economy as US trade war intensifies    US President Donald Trump has also threatened to extend punitive tariffs to all Chinese imports.        China retaliated with a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion of US imports and variable tariffs of 5 per cent to 10 per cent on a further US$60 billion of US imports.        China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi (left) and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a testy exchange on Monday in Beijing. Photo: AP    Washington is demanding China change its trade practices of forcing US businesses to transfer technologies and of subsidising state-owned enterprises.        Zhong reiterated Beijing’s line that China does not steal technology from US firms.        “I want to emphasise that China’s laws and regulations do not contain any requirement for technology transfer and that companies’ purchases of technologies and patents are pure market behaviour ” he said.        “China’s economic development  and science and technological progress are owed to reform and opening up and the endeavours of the Chinese people.”        As US turns up heat on China  trade war moves beyond tariffs to new battlefronts    Zhong also argued that China never “took advantage of the US” even as the country ran a record trade surplus of US$31.05 billion with the US in August.        “If one side had been taken advantage of all the time  could such business relations have continued? Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage of ” Zhong said.        The conflict between the two countries has now gone beyond trade  with Trump’s accusations that China is attempting to interfere in the 2018 US midterm congressional elections. Vice-President Mike Pence also stepped up the attack by condemning Beijing for using “every tool at its disposal” to undermine the US political system.        Pence also warned American companies  including tech giant Alphabet  which owns Google  to disengage from China.Trump rips up the trade playbook to take on China        Donna Borak  CNN        Updated 1037 GMT (1837 HKT) October 9  2018        Bali  Indonesia (CNN)President Donald Trump wants a deal with China — just not anytime soon.        After announcing a revamped trade agreement with Canada and Mexico last week  Trump reeled off a list of other countries that he said had given in to US demands to hold talks or make a deal: South Korea  Japan  the European Union.    He scoffed at those \"babies out there\" who worried about the effects of tariffs  suggesting that \"we wouldn\\\\ t be talking about a deal\" with Canada and Mexico without his confrontational approach.    The trade war will hit US and Chinese growth next year  the IMF warns    \"That\\\\ s going to embolden him to impose more tariffs and threaten more in the hopes of getting a better deal out of China \" said Edward Alden  a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.   \"Trump s no-holds-barred strategy on China is likely take center stage this week at a summit of global finance chiefs and central bankers in Bali  Indonesia. And it ll be up to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  the president s top economic envoy  to argue the US case as warnings intensify about the damage a protracted trade war could do to global economic growth.\"   \"The stakes are high \" Christine Lagarde  the managing director of the International Monetary Fund  said last week. \"We need to work together to de-escalate and resolve the current trade disputes.\"   \" Coalition of the willing \"  \"If the Trump administration can get the European Union and Japan on side following the recent trade deals with South Korea  Canada and Mexico  that s likely to strengthen the US negotiating position with Beijing  top administration officials argue.\"   US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA        US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA 01:58    \"We are talking to the European Union again  we are talking to Japan again  and we are moving to what I have characterized as a trade coalition of the willing to confront China \" Larry Kudlow  Trump\\\\ s chief economic adviser  said last week.   \"But talks with Europe and Japan are still in the early stages. And French President Emmanuel Macron said last month that Europe shouldn t sign trade deals with any country that doesn t comply with the Paris Agreement on climate change  a clear reference to the United States.\"  \"The Trump administration s approach to building a coalition against Beijing is a break from the old playbook of working collaboratively with allies to address mutual concerns.\"   Other big economies like the European Union and Japan share some of the main US grievances with China  including intellectual property theft and pressure on foreign companies to hand over technology to Chinese partners. But Trump slapped tariffs on key allies at the same time as stepping up his campaign against China  which some analysts suggest has weakened any potential united front.    The Trump administration has imposed new tariffs on about half of China&#39;s annual goods exports to the United States.    Souring relationship   \"Trump has made clear he s in no rush to restart talks with Beijing anytime soon. Instead  he has threatened to impose an even bigger wave of tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese products. That would mean the US measures effectively cover all the goods China sells to the United States each year.\"   \"I\\\\ m using them to negotiate \" Trump said of the tariffs. \"And hopefully  we can make a great deal with China — a fair deal and a reciprocal deal.\"    Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Details of the revised pact with Canada and Mexico  which is set to replace NAFTA  show that the US government is also trying other ways to amplify the pressure on China.    Tucked in the new agreement is a requirement that each country inform the others if it wants to start free trade negotiations with a \"non-market economy \" a clear reference to China. The other countries would also be able to review any potential free trade deal with China.    That move has upset Beijing  further souring the relationship between the two economic superpowers.    In a frank exchange of views in Beijing on Monday  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the United States should immediately stop its \"wrong remarks and actions \" including the trade war. Pompeo responded that the two countries have a \"fundamental disagreement\" and that the United States has \"great concerns about actions that China has taken.\"   \" How much pain are they willing to endure? \"   Neither side is showing signs of backing down.   \"The United States  whose economy relies less on exports than China s  is faring better so far. China s economy had already started slowing down this year and its stock markets and currency have slumped as the trade conflict has escalated.\"   China is pumping more cash into its economy as the trade war heats up    \"The question is: How much pain are they willing to endure?\" said Thomas Bernes  a distinguished fellow for the Centre for International Governance Innovation. \"They will be looking to the midterm elections to see if there is going to be a rejection of Trumpism or whether they he gains strength and remains in power.\"    For its part  the Trump administration appears willing to maintain the pressure for as long as it can.    \"We have changed the paradigm \" US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said last month. \"We have tariffs in place  and the president is not going to let this go along when you have forced transfer of intellectual property.\"    Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires at the end of November.    But with Beijing unwilling to give ground on US demands that it change fundamental parts of its economic policy  the prospects of reaching a deal anytime soon appear slim.    \"It is still hard to see how a further escalation of the trade conflict with China will be avoided \" Andrew Hunter  US economist at research firm Capital Economics said in a note to clients last week.Is China or Russia America’s Defining Rival?    The debate doesn’t just have consequences for U.S. foreign policy—it will define the next decades of domestic affairs as well.        OCT 9  2018        Late last week  as most of America’s political class was transfixed by the denouement of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle  Vice President Mike Pence gave a wide-ranging address on the U.S. relationship with China  and why the Trump administration is committed to opposing its expansionist designs. For the most part  it was a familiar litany of complaints about China’s efforts to coerce its neighbors in the western Pacific  its trade abuses  its hostility to religious freedom  and its support of unsavory regimes around the world. Yet halfway through his remarks  the vice president shifted his emphasis  turning from all the various ways the Chinese party-state was acting in the world outside America’s borders to how it was seeking to influence political and cultural life inside them.        Specifically  Pence warned that “China wants a different American president ” and that Beijing was mobilizing “covert actors  front groups  and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policies” to that end. By now  it has become routine for the heads of U.S. multinationals to condemn the Trump administration’s trade policies  and the fact that they’d do so is perfectly understandable. China’s violent labor repression and its policy of subsidizing industrialists at the expense of households have proved highly advantageous to those seeking a disciplined and relatively low-cost workforce  regardless of their citizenship. According to Pence  however  there is another layer to the politics of trade  namely that senior Chinese officials are threatening to punish business leaders who fail to denounce U.S. tariffs. He pointed to the rising sophistication with which Beijing exploits America’s domestic political cleavages  as evidenced by its targeting of retaliatory tariffs to regions and industries believed crucial to the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections  and its shrewd efforts to silence criticism of Chinese policies on university campuses desperate for Chinese money.

Some observers have dismissed the idea  warning that it represents a distraction from ongoing Russian meddling. Others acknowledge that while China’s efforts to influence democratic outcomes are different in character from Russia’s approach  which Beijing seems to see as “ineffective and counterproductive ” there is no question that  as Rush Doshi and Robert D. Williams of the Brookings Institution have cautiously observed  “China has long pursued a wide-ranging and very real campaign to influence the political and informational environment of other countries  including the United States.”        Needless to say  one could see both Russia and China as dangerous rivals  and I certainly do. But in an age of intensifying partisan enmity  when large numbers of Americans question the legitimacy of the Trump presidency while similarly large numbers see Donald Trump as their champion  it is fitting that Democrats and Republicans can’t bring themselves to agree on which of the world’s revanchist powers ought to serve as what you might call our orienting enemy or  as the Harvard political scientist Samuel P. Huntington once put it  the “other” that gives our grand strategy its ideological shape.        In 1997  not long after the collapse of the Soviet bloc  Huntington warned that American grand strategy was losing its coherence in part because America’s creedal identity had long been defined in opposition to just such an “other.” In the early days of the republic  he observed  it was Britain that offered this necessary contrast: While the British lived under tyranny and hierarchy  Americans told themselves  we enjoyed freedom and equality. So  too  in later years did Wilhelmine Germany provide an orienting rivalry  and then the Nazi and Soviet totalitarianisms that ravaged the world for much of the 20th century. The Soviet Union’s demise therefore prompted a kind of identity crisis. “While wars at times may have a divisive effect on society ” wrote Huntington  “a common enemy can often help to promote identity and cohesion among people. The weakening or absence of a common enemy can do just the reverse.”        What Huntington did not quite anticipate is that America would find itself divided between two creedal identities—one right  one left—each of which defines itself against a different enemy. This is a pattern that has obtained in earlier eras. Consider that the founding generation was bitterly divided over whether Revolutionary France or the British Empire represented the greater threat to American liberty. The early 1900s saw debates between Germanophiles  many of whom were progressives and socialists of German extraction  and Anglophiles who embraced the idea of a world order jointly administered by a British-American condominium. The difference now is that even in the supposed twilight of American global leadership  our creedal clashes reverberate around the world.        And so the United States finds itself in the midst of not one but two cold wars. To cosmopolitan liberals  it is Russia that serves as America’s chief geopolitical adversary. Even in Russia’s weakened and impoverished state  they fear the deftness with which its operatives act in connivance with illiberal elements in the world’s diverse market democracies to undermine them from within. Nationalist conservatives see rising Chinese power as the far graver threat to American interests  and they are increasingly open to wielding the power of the state to resist and counter Beijing’s depredations  despite the cost to economic freedom that may well result.        It is not difficult to understand why Russia has such a hold on the liberal imagination. There is at this point little doubt that the Russian state has sought to sow chaos and division in the U.S. and democratic Europe  in part out of a conviction that Western liberals have done much the same throughout post-Soviet Eurasia. Though the extent to which Russian information operations influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election is contested  the notion that it played a decisive role is an article of faith among Trump’s liberal critics  for whom Vladimir Putin is the perfect foil.        The Putin ascendancy has been defined by  in the first place  rank kleptocracy  but also by an explicit and often deranged antiliberalism  in which the chief enemies of the Russian nation are the forces of gay rights and feminism. As the American author Timothy Snyder has argued  Putinism’s crusade against gay rights was designed “to transform demands for democracy into a nebulous threat to Russian innocence: voting = west = sodomy.” While defining liberalism as the politics of sexual perversion  Putin defines his own regime as the defender of masculinity and traditionalism  and as the natural ally of all those who defend state sovereignty against the supposed cosmopolitan conspiracy to dissolve the natural family. In short  Putin invites cosmopolitan liberals to see Russia under his rule as their enemy  just as he invites right-wing populists in the Western democracies to see him as a friend.        An America that defines itself against Putin’s Russia is an America that would redouble its commitment to cosmopolitan liberalism  including a commitment to free and open trade on a multilateral  nondiscriminatory basis  while marginalizing nationalist conservatism as retrograde. nato would be shored up  which is all to the good  but the U.S. would adopt a warier attitude toward populist parties in Central and Eastern Europe  a stance that could see these democracies drift further out of the American orbit.        And as for the Chinese party-state  it wouldn’t exactly be a friend  especially in light of its hostility to civil liberties  but the Chinese Communist Party’s stated commitment to combating climate change and antitrade nationalist politicians would lend it a certain prestige and legitimacy. Shortly after Trump’s inauguration  Xi Jinping presented himself as a defender of a rules-based international order  the Paris agreement  and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran  and in doing so he won himself admirers in elite circles  especially among those unaware of the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims for political crimes. Over time  a U.S. grand strategy rooted in cosmopolitan liberalism might grow warier of Chinese power  especially if the Chinese party-state were to become more explicitly nationalist as it sees less of a need to cater to cosmopolitan-liberal sensibilities  as seems likely. But by then the economic integration of the Western democracies with China might be irreversible  and Beijing would have the upper hand.        What would it mean for the U.S. to instead choose China as its “other ” as nationalist conservatives would have it? One early indication comes from a recent report from the Department of Defense  which details America’s growing dependence on China’s manufacturing base  and the threat this poses to the country’s war-fighting capabilities. In the 1990s and 2000s  market conservatives could point to the Soviet collapse as an indictment of statism  and to global economic integration as an unambiguous good. Many of these market conservatives now find themselves making common cause with cosmopolitan liberals while nationalist conservatives rethink their commitment to laissez-faire  with an eye toward meeting the challenge posed by a Chinese party-state that sees industrial progress as central to its strategic ambitions. If Beijing  not Moscow  is public enemy No. 1  it is vital that the U.S. boost public investment in infrastructure and human capital  and that it steer U.S. firms to build resilient supply chains based in the Americas  not in China’s industrial heartland. Russia would still be a rival  I suspect  but it would be seen through a different lens: as a potential ally in the protracted conflict with China  as would become much clearer once Putin himself exits the scene.        Culturally  choosing China as an orienting enemy would have more ambiguous effects. One can imagine a xenophobic turn against Chinese immigrants  visitors  and students  which would have ugly consequences. Yet one can also imagine an embrace of the Chinese people on the grounds that Beijing’s authoritarianism serves a narrow elite more than it serves ordinary workers. The argument  in essence  would be that the U.S. stands against the party-state  not China as a whole  and that America would welcome a more just and inclusive Chinese government. Indeed  Pence made exactly this argument in his recent address. More broadly  an America waging a cold war on China might place a somewhat greater emphasis on cohesion and solidarity over cosmopolitanism  not least because disentangling the American and Chinese economies would entail considerable sacrifice on the part of the U.S. business elite—a sacrifice that would have to be justified in solidaristic terms.        Which enemy will we choose in the years to come? Which cold war will we wage most assiduously? The answer will depend in no small part on the outcome of the elections to come. If history is any guide  the stakes are high  and the consequences will be enduring.Chinese Media Vow to Fight Against ‘Insult’ from Pence  Threaten ‘Cold War’        8 Oct 2018        China’s state-run Global Times vowed over the weekend to fight back against “insults” from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and promised a “new Cold War” if the Trump administration forces the issue by continuing to produce “hostile reports and speeches.”    The Global Times took a passive-aggressive approach in an editorial on Sunday  beginning with strong criticism of Pence’s speech at the Hudson Institute last Thursday and citing observers who compared it to Sir Winston Churchill’s “Iron Curtain” speech about the Soviet Union at the dawn of the Cold War.        The editorial soon mellowed into a reflection on high points of the relationship between America and China  such as U.S. President Richard Nixon’s opening to China  and even took some credit for helping President Ronald Reagan put the Soviet Union out of business.        The Global Times then reiterated Beijing’s standard line about how soft  democratic America stands no chance against authoritarian China in a trade war and positioned Beijing as the more mature player in a conflict Washington has not yet realized it cannot win:        The US  in fact  has limited leverage to contain China. A trade war will inevitably damage the US and is a stupid choice. It’s unrealistic to establish a NATO-style organization to target China. It is impossible to isolate and contain China given its expanding business overseas and domestic markets.        It’s difficult for the White House and Congress to mobilize an anti-China campaign in US society. Gone are the days when the public was willing to take a plunge for the so-called national interest. As long as China keeps calm in the face of hysterical US political elites  the so-called Cold War will not take shape.        At such a time  China should play tai chi with the US. This is the unique strategic wisdom of the Chinese nation. We must make the US feel the pain of the trade war and not allow the US to act unscrupulously in the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits. But we must act in a calm way. China will continue to open up. A deteriorating outside world will not change that.        China is not the Soviet Union. The US cannot deal with China as it did with the Soviet Union.        That last line became a Chinese political mantra with blinding speed after Pence’s speech to the Hudson Institute was compared to Churchill’s Iron Curtain speech.        On Monday  the Global Times pronounced China hurt and confused by the “stinging” speech Pence delivered to the Hudson Institute  filled with accusations that were “vitriolic  ruthless  and delivered in terms considered far from decorous.”        This second editorial invoked the “Thucydides Trap ” which has become another common talking point for Chinese politicians. The Thucydides Trap is a theory that posits ruling powers almost always go to war with rising powers  usually to the regret of both nations  unless extraordinary efforts are made to avoid conflict.        Beijing’s interpretation of Thucydides is that America has a unique responsibility to welcome China as a new global superpower and refrain from protecting American dominance by attempting to “contain” China.        As far as the Chinese are concerned  they are already doing everything a rising power could possibly do to ameliorate the concerns of the aging world hegemon  and they cannot understand why the Trump administration suddenly decided to make a “U-turn” at the urging of “hardliners” and commence efforts to contain China.        The Global Times defended the ad China took out in the Des Moines Register in September  widely seen as a major reason for the Trump administration’s complaint about Chinese interference in U.S. elections.        “Where is the U.S.’ long-hailed freedom of the press?” a state-run newspaper from one of the world’s most aggressive authoritarian regimes risibly asked. In a similar vein  the Global Times portrayed China as merely seeking to defend itself from a “U.S.-initiated trade war ” as if China has not been manipulating markets and stealing technology for decades.        The Global Times concluded President Trump is beating up on China to goose Republican turnout for the midterm elections and distract from “the Russiagate scandal”:        The reason that the Trump administration deliberately chose this timing – when China-US trade tensions are ratcheting up – to deliver the inflammatory speech is the upcoming US midterm elections.        Trump knows that playing the China card is always the safest option. It cannot only divert domestic attention from the Russiagate scandal and shift the political pressure from the president but also incite ordinary voters.        These unfounded accusations show that the understanding and judgment of the Trump administration on Sino-US relations are unprofessional  shallow and indiscreet  which is most worrying. The worsening atmosphere toward China in the US not only affects American public’ opinion on the country but also endangers the safety and interests of Chinese in the US.        When the leader of a state accuses other countries at will  how can he justify his reputation to improve bilateral ties? Perhaps the Trump government needs to think about how to show respect to China before requesting China to respect the US.        The Chinese appear to know the American left is very receptive to theories that President Trump relies on populist appeals to xenophobia and is desperate to distract from the investigation into “Russian collusion” in the 2016 election.“Utterly messed up my life”: What Chinese people really think of the trade war        The Guardian By Echo HuangOctober 9  2018        China’s ardent determination to win the trade war might not have all the public support it would like.        Since the US and China entered a trade war in earnest this year  both sides have been going tit-for-tat with increasing tariffs on goods. The US has put new tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports  while China has done the same to $110 billion worth of US goods. And while China’s running out of US goods to keep the retaliation going  its strongest weapon in this “war of national fate” with the US is the spirit of the Chinese people  according to state media.       \"“The heroism of ‘being the first to show concern and the last to enjoy oneself’ has always run through Chinese blood  which also includes the spirit of ‘sacrificing one’s interest for the greater good of the public  ” said an opinion piece (link in Chinese) posted by the state-run People’s Daily on July 10. “Facing this ‘war of national fate ’ Chinese are deeply aware that ‘there’s no home without a country ’ so they are willing to bear temporary losses.”\"       That comment doesn’t acknowledge how painful the trade war could become for common people. Economists estimate that if the latest Chinese goods to be added to the trade war see tariffs go up to 25% next year  it could shave half a percentage point off China’s growth. Online  people are sharing how they’re experiencing the impacts so far  and worrying about what’s to come.        Stocks tumble  yuan devalues    On Monday (Oct.7)  the first day after the Golden Week holiday  Chinese stocks fell sharply. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.7%—its biggest single-day loss (paywall)  in more than three months. The stock tumble came a day after China’s central bank announced that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks for the fourth time this year—a move seen as trying to boost the economy by increasing liquidity amid the trade war. In general  China’s stock markets haven’t been (paywall) taking the trade war in stride.        “This has been a tough year for me. I haven’t received payments on several projects because of stock bursts ” wrote a user (link in Chinese) of social media platform Weibo  who identified himself as working at a securities firm in Beijing. “The stock market’s tumble and the trade war have killed many projects. When I returned home  the village officials asked me how’s my work so far this year. My answer  sadly  was this—deleveraging  bad stock performance  and the trade war have utterly messed up my life.”        REUTERS/MARIANA BAZO    Looking for new markets.    The devalued yuan has also worried many. While it could help exporters by making their goods more competitive  it makes life tougher for people who need foreign currency  for example families of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese studying abroad.        “We are now kneeling to the trade war. It’s hard to see that the RMB [renminbi] can be stable in the near term. Looks like the Great Depression is going to arrive ” said a Weibo comment (link in Chinese).        Snacks  oil prices up    Treats are suddenly more expensive due to tariffs  and so are daily necessities.        “I ran out of nuts yesterday and wanted to top up my stock ” wrote a female user (link in Chinese) based in northern Hebei province  but she found the nuts she’s used to eating every day  including pecans  commonly sourced from the US  cost her more.        “I asked the shop owner  ‘Why is it more expensive than last time?’ The owner said it’s because of the trade war ” she continued  “And I asked him  ‘What’s the relationship?’ He said that he had imported lots of the nuts from overseas. This is the first time I feel the impact of the trade war.”        As for Maine lobster  forget about it.        Chinese drivers are also feeling the pinch  with China putting tariffs on US oil imports in August.        “I’ve deeply felt that the economic environment is not good. This year  there’s peer-to-peer lending and illegal money-raising crackdown  which also bled out a bunch of people. Now the drop has come to the real estate market…. then there’s the trade war  and oil prices keep going up. It won’t be long before I can’t afford to run my car ” wrote a user (link in Chinese).        Small businesses may be harder hit than larger ones. The most recent Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index  a better gauge of sentiment at smaller  private firms than the official manufacturing PMI  declined from 50.6 in August to 50 last month  the lowest level in more than a year. A number below 50 indicates a contraction.        REUTERS    In response to US tariffs  China has put tariffs on American soybean imports.    Pessimism about the new NAFTA    People aren’t optimistic the pressure on China’s economy will ease up. In fact  the new North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiated by the US  Mexico  and Canada—now with a brand-new acronym—shows the formation of a front against China  some online commenters noted.        “Why is the Chinese economy going to be difficult in the next six months?” wrote a male user (link in Chinese) of micro-blogging site Weibo  based in China’s southwestern Sichuan province. His argument that the elements that have been key to driving China’s economic growth in recent years—including infrastructure  foreign trade  and domestic demands—have all shown worrying signs.         “In terms of foreign trade  this is the most worrying ” he wrote. “The Americans are launching trade wars worldwide because they want to bypass the WTO [World Trade Organization] and build something new. At the end of September  the US  Canada and Mexico signed a new cooperation agreement. The agreement said if a ‘non-market-oriented economy‘ wants to enter their market  it needs the approval of all the three countries… Everyone knows who this ‘non-market-oriented economy’ is.”        (The new NAFTA asks countries in the agreement to notify each other if they are to have trade deal talks with a “non-market” economy  and also give one another a say in the deal.)        “Americans have been building an anti-China circle. In the first round  the Mexico gave in  then Canada. I am afraid that the third round is Japan  then Europe ” said another (link in Chinese). “I highly suggest that China should make major adjustments to its current policies instead of listening to the opinions from so-called elites.”China won’t back down in trade war with US: commerce minister        SCMP Amanda Lee        China will not cave in to US demands even if it faces further tariffs on its exports  China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan has said  signalling Beijing’s uncompromising stance in dealing with US.        “There is a view in the US that so long as the US keeps increasing tariffs  China will back down. They don’t know the history and culture of China ” Zhong said  in a statement published by Bloomberg News.        “This unyielding nation suffered foreign bullying for many times in history  but never succumbed to it even in the most difficult conditions. China doesn’t want a trade war  but would rise up to it should it break out.        “The US should not underestimate China’s resolve and will.”            This is Beijing’s strongest response yet to the trade war following a release of a white paper last month detailing its stance on the trade war  in which China blamed the US for creating the tensions and painted itself as a promoter of free trade.        The strong comments from Zhong  whose ministry is in the front line of any possible talks with the US  coincide with a rapid deterioration in the ties between Beijing and Washington.        Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage ofCHINA’S COMMERCE MINISTER ZHONG SHAN    US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  on a brief visit to Beijing on Monday  had a testy exchange with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.        Wang told Pompeo the US had hurt “mutual trust” and must stop “misguided actions” against China  while Pompeo said there were “fundamental disagreements” between the two powers.        Prospects for Beijing and Washington to de-escalate their trade tensions are not bright.        The two sides have locked horns in levying punitive tariffs against each other and there are gaping differences over a slew of issues from intellectual property rights to the role of state-owned enterprises.            The US initially imposed a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion worth of Chinese imports  and in September added a 10 per cent tariff on an additional US$200 billion of Chinese products  with the tariff rate set to rise to 25 per cent on January 1 if China does not make trade concessions.        China’s central bank to pump US$110 billion into economy as US trade war intensifies    US President Donald Trump has also threatened to extend punitive tariffs to all Chinese imports.        China retaliated with a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion of US imports and variable tariffs of 5 per cent to 10 per cent on a further US$60 billion of US imports.        China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi (left) and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a testy exchange on Monday in Beijing. Photo: AP    Washington is demanding China change its trade practices of forcing US businesses to transfer technologies and of subsidising state-owned enterprises.        Zhong reiterated Beijing’s line that China does not steal technology from US firms.        “I want to emphasise that China’s laws and regulations do not contain any requirement for technology transfer and that companies’ purchases of technologies and patents are pure market behaviour ” he said.        “China’s economic development  and science and technological progress are owed to reform and opening up and the endeavours of the Chinese people.”        As US turns up heat on China  trade war moves beyond tariffs to new battlefronts    Zhong also argued that China never “took advantage of the US” even as the country ran a record trade surplus of US$31.05 billion with the US in August.        “If one side had been taken advantage of all the time  could such business relations have continued? Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage of ” Zhong said.        The conflict between the two countries has now gone beyond trade  with Trump’s accusations that China is attempting to interfere in the 2018 US midterm congressional elections. Vice-President Mike Pence also stepped up the attack by condemning Beijing for using “every tool at its disposal” to undermine the US political system.        Pence also warned American companies  including tech giant Alphabet  which owns Google  to disengage from China.Trump rips up the trade playbook to take on China        Donna Borak  CNN        Updated 1037 GMT (1837 HKT) October 9  2018        Bali  Indonesia (CNN)President Donald Trump wants a deal with China — just not anytime soon.        After announcing a revamped trade agreement with Canada and Mexico last week  Trump reeled off a list of other countries that he said had given in to US demands to hold talks or make a deal: South Korea  Japan  the European Union.    He scoffed at those \"babies out there\" who worried about the effects of tariffs  suggesting that \"we wouldn\\\\ t be talking about a deal\" with Canada and Mexico without his confrontational approach.    The trade war will hit US and Chinese growth next year  the IMF warns    \"That\\\\ s going to embolden him to impose more tariffs and threaten more in the hopes of getting a better deal out of China \" said Edward Alden  a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.   \"Trump s no-holds-barred strategy on China is likely take center stage this week at a summit of global finance chiefs and central bankers in Bali  Indonesia. And it ll be up to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  the president s top economic envoy  to argue the US case as warnings intensify about the damage a protracted trade war could do to global economic growth.\"   \"The stakes are high \" Christine Lagarde  the managing director of the International Monetary Fund  said last week. \"We need to work together to de-escalate and resolve the current trade disputes.\"   \" Coalition of the willing \"  \"If the Trump administration can get the European Union and Japan on side following the recent trade deals with South Korea  Canada and Mexico  that s likely to strengthen the US negotiating position with Beijing  top administration officials argue.\"   US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA        US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA 01:58    \"We are talking to the European Union again  we are talking to Japan again  and we are moving to what I have characterized as a trade coalition of the willing to confront China \" Larry Kudlow  Trump\\\\ s chief economic adviser  said last week.   \"But talks with Europe and Japan are still in the early stages. And French President Emmanuel Macron said last month that Europe shouldn t sign trade deals with any country that doesn t comply with the Paris Agreement on climate change  a clear reference to the United States.\"  \"The Trump administration s approach to building a coalition against Beijing is a break from the old playbook of working collaboratively with allies to address mutual concerns.\"   Other big economies like the European Union and Japan share some of the main US grievances with China  including intellectual property theft and pressure on foreign companies to hand over technology to Chinese partners. But Trump slapped tariffs on key allies at the same time as stepping up his campaign against China  which some analysts suggest has weakened any potential united front.    The Trump administration has imposed new tariffs on about half of China&#39;s annual goods exports to the United States.    Souring relationship   \"Trump has made clear he s in no rush to restart talks with Beijing anytime soon. Instead  he has threatened to impose an even bigger wave of tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese products. That would mean the US measures effectively cover all the goods China sells to the United States each year.\"   \"I\\\\ m using them to negotiate \" Trump said of the tariffs. \"And hopefully  we can make a great deal with China — a fair deal and a reciprocal deal.\"    Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Details of the revised pact with Canada and Mexico  which is set to replace NAFTA  show that the US government is also trying other ways to amplify the pressure on China.    Tucked in the new agreement is a requirement that each country inform the others if it wants to start free trade negotiations with a \"non-market economy \" a clear reference to China. The other countries would also be able to review any potential free trade deal with China.    That move has upset Beijing  further souring the relationship between the two economic superpowers.    In a frank exchange of views in Beijing on Monday  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the United States should immediately stop its \"wrong remarks and actions \" including the trade war. Pompeo responded that the two countries have a \"fundamental disagreement\" and that the United States has \"great concerns about actions that China has taken.\"   \" How much pain are they willing to endure? \"   Neither side is showing signs of backing down.   \"The United States  whose economy relies less on exports than China s  is faring better so far. China s economy had already started slowing down this year and its stock markets and currency have slumped as the trade conflict has escalated.\"   China is pumping more cash into its economy as the trade war heats up    \"The question is: How much pain are they willing to endure?\" said Thomas Bernes  a distinguished fellow for the Centre for International Governance Innovation. \"They will be looking to the midterm elections to see if there is going to be a rejection of Trumpism or whether they he gains strength and remains in power.\"    For its part  the Trump administration appears willing to maintain the pressure for as long as it can.    \"We have changed the paradigm \" US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said last month. \"We have tariffs in place  and the president is not going to let this go along when you have forced transfer of intellectual property.\"    Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires at the end of November.    But with Beijing unwilling to give ground on US demands that it change fundamental parts of its economic policy  the prospects of reaching a deal anytime soon appear slim.    \"It is still hard to see how a further escalation of the trade conflict with China will be avoided \" Andrew Hunter  US economist at research firm Capital Economics said in a note to clients last week.Is China or Russia America’s Defining Rival?    The debate doesn’t just have consequences for U.S. foreign policy—it will define the next decades of domestic affairs as well.        OCT 9  2018        Late last week  as most of America’s political class was transfixed by the denouement of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle  Vice President Mike Pence gave a wide-ranging address on the U.S. relationship with China  and why the Trump administration is committed to opposing its expansionist designs. For the most part  it was a familiar litany of complaints about China’s efforts to coerce its neighbors in the western Pacific  its trade abuses  its hostility to religious freedom  and its support of unsavory regimes around the world. Yet halfway through his remarks  the vice president shifted his emphasis  turning from all the various ways the Chinese party-state was acting in the world outside America’s borders to how it was seeking to influence political and cultural life inside them.        Specifically  Pence warned that “China wants a different American president ” and that Beijing was mobilizing “covert actors  front groups  and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policies” to that end. By now  it has become routine for the heads of U.S. multinationals to condemn the Trump administration’s trade policies  and the fact that they’d do so is perfectly understandable. China’s violent labor repression and its policy of subsidizing industrialists at the expense of households have proved highly advantageous to those seeking a disciplined and relatively low-cost workforce  regardless of their citizenship. According to Pence  however  there is another layer to the politics of trade  namely that senior Chinese officials are threatening to punish business leaders who fail to denounce U.S. tariffs. He pointed to the rising sophistication with which Beijing exploits America’s domestic political cleavages  as evidenced by its targeting of retaliatory tariffs to regions and industries believed crucial to the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections  and its shrewd efforts to silence criticism of Chinese policies on university campuses desperate for Chinese money.

Some observers have dismissed the idea  warning that it represents a distraction from ongoing Russian meddling. Others acknowledge that while China’s efforts to influence democratic outcomes are different in character from Russia’s approach  which Beijing seems to see as “ineffective and counterproductive ” there is no question that  as Rush Doshi and Robert D. Williams of the Brookings Institution have cautiously observed  “China has long pursued a wide-ranging and very real campaign to influence the political and informational environment of other countries  including the United States.”        Needless to say  one could see both Russia and China as dangerous rivals  and I certainly do. But in an age of intensifying partisan enmity  when large numbers of Americans question the legitimacy of the Trump presidency while similarly large numbers see Donald Trump as their champion  it is fitting that Democrats and Republicans can’t bring themselves to agree on which of the world’s revanchist powers ought to serve as what you might call our orienting enemy or  as the Harvard political scientist Samuel P. Huntington once put it  the “other” that gives our grand strategy its ideological shape.        In 1997  not long after the collapse of the Soviet bloc  Huntington warned that American grand strategy was losing its coherence in part because America’s creedal identity had long been defined in opposition to just such an “other.” In the early days of the republic  he observed  it was Britain that offered this necessary contrast: While the British lived under tyranny and hierarchy  Americans told themselves  we enjoyed freedom and equality. So  too  in later years did Wilhelmine Germany provide an orienting rivalry  and then the Nazi and Soviet totalitarianisms that ravaged the world for much of the 20th century. The Soviet Union’s demise therefore prompted a kind of identity crisis. “While wars at times may have a divisive effect on society ” wrote Huntington  “a common enemy can often help to promote identity and cohesion among people. The weakening or absence of a common enemy can do just the reverse.”        What Huntington did not quite anticipate is that America would find itself divided between two creedal identities—one right  one left—each of which defines itself against a different enemy. This is a pattern that has obtained in earlier eras. Consider that the founding generation was bitterly divided over whether Revolutionary France or the British Empire represented the greater threat to American liberty. The early 1900s saw debates between Germanophiles  many of whom were progressives and socialists of German extraction  and Anglophiles who embraced the idea of a world order jointly administered by a British-American condominium. The difference now is that even in the supposed twilight of American global leadership  our creedal clashes reverberate around the world.        And so the United States finds itself in the midst of not one but two cold wars. To cosmopolitan liberals  it is Russia that serves as America’s chief geopolitical adversary. Even in Russia’s weakened and impoverished state  they fear the deftness with which its operatives act in connivance with illiberal elements in the world’s diverse market democracies to undermine them from within. Nationalist conservatives see rising Chinese power as the far graver threat to American interests  and they are increasingly open to wielding the power of the state to resist and counter Beijing’s depredations  despite the cost to economic freedom that may well result.        It is not difficult to understand why Russia has such a hold on the liberal imagination. There is at this point little doubt that the Russian state has sought to sow chaos and division in the U.S. and democratic Europe  in part out of a conviction that Western liberals have done much the same throughout post-Soviet Eurasia. Though the extent to which Russian information operations influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election is contested  the notion that it played a decisive role is an article of faith among Trump’s liberal critics  for whom Vladimir Putin is the perfect foil.        The Putin ascendancy has been defined by  in the first place  rank kleptocracy  but also by an explicit and often deranged antiliberalism  in which the chief enemies of the Russian nation are the forces of gay rights and feminism. As the American author Timothy Snyder has argued  Putinism’s crusade against gay rights was designed “to transform demands for democracy into a nebulous threat to Russian innocence: voting = west = sodomy.” While defining liberalism as the politics of sexual perversion  Putin defines his own regime as the defender of masculinity and traditionalism  and as the natural ally of all those who defend state sovereignty against the supposed cosmopolitan conspiracy to dissolve the natural family. In short  Putin invites cosmopolitan liberals to see Russia under his rule as their enemy  just as he invites right-wing populists in the Western democracies to see him as a friend.        An America that defines itself against Putin’s Russia is an America that would redouble its commitment to cosmopolitan liberalism  including a commitment to free and open trade on a multilateral  nondiscriminatory basis  while marginalizing nationalist conservatism as retrograde. nato would be shored up  which is all to the good  but the U.S. would adopt a warier attitude toward populist parties in Central and Eastern Europe  a stance that could see these democracies drift further out of the American orbit.        And as for the Chinese party-state  it wouldn’t exactly be a friend  especially in light of its hostility to civil liberties  but the Chinese Communist Party’s stated commitment to combating climate change and antitrade nationalist politicians would lend it a certain prestige and legitimacy. Shortly after Trump’s inauguration  Xi Jinping presented himself as a defender of a rules-based international order  the Paris agreement  and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran  and in doing so he won himself admirers in elite circles  especially among those unaware of the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims for political crimes. Over time  a U.S. grand strategy rooted in cosmopolitan liberalism might grow warier of Chinese power  especially if the Chinese party-state were to become more explicitly nationalist as it sees less of a need to cater to cosmopolitan-liberal sensibilities  as seems likely. But by then the economic integration of the Western democracies with China might be irreversible  and Beijing would have the upper hand.        What would it mean for the U.S. to instead choose China as its “other ” as nationalist conservatives would have it? One early indication comes from a recent report from the Department of Defense  which details America’s growing dependence on China’s manufacturing base  and the threat this poses to the country’s war-fighting capabilities. In the 1990s and 2000s  market conservatives could point to the Soviet collapse as an indictment of statism  and to global economic integration as an unambiguous good. Many of these market conservatives now find themselves making common cause with cosmopolitan liberals while nationalist conservatives rethink their commitment to laissez-faire  with an eye toward meeting the challenge posed by a Chinese party-state that sees industrial progress as central to its strategic ambitions. If Beijing  not Moscow  is public enemy No. 1  it is vital that the U.S. boost public investment in infrastructure and human capital  and that it steer U.S. firms to build resilient supply chains based in the Americas  not in China’s industrial heartland. Russia would still be a rival  I suspect  but it would be seen through a different lens: as a potential ally in the protracted conflict with China  as would become much clearer once Putin himself exits the scene.        Culturally  choosing China as an orienting enemy would have more ambiguous effects. One can imagine a xenophobic turn against Chinese immigrants  visitors  and students  which would have ugly consequences. Yet one can also imagine an embrace of the Chinese people on the grounds that Beijing’s authoritarianism serves a narrow elite more than it serves ordinary workers. The argument  in essence  would be that the U.S. stands against the party-state  not China as a whole  and that America would welcome a more just and inclusive Chinese government. Indeed  Pence made exactly this argument in his recent address. More broadly  an America waging a cold war on China might place a somewhat greater emphasis on cohesion and solidarity over cosmopolitanism  not least because disentangling the American and Chinese economies would entail considerable sacrifice on the part of the U.S. business elite—a sacrifice that would have to be justified in solidaristic terms.        Which enemy will we choose in the years to come? Which cold war will we wage most assiduously? The answer will depend in no small part on the outcome of the elections to come. If history is any guide  the stakes are high  and the consequences will be enduring.Chinese Media Vow to Fight Against ‘Insult’ from Pence  Threaten ‘Cold War’        8 Oct 2018        China’s state-run Global Times vowed over the weekend to fight back against “insults” from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and promised a “new Cold War” if the Trump administration forces the issue by continuing to produce “hostile reports and speeches.”    The Global Times took a passive-aggressive approach in an editorial on Sunday  beginning with strong criticism of Pence’s speech at the Hudson Institute last Thursday and citing observers who compared it to Sir Winston Churchill’s “Iron Curtain” speech about the Soviet Union at the dawn of the Cold War.        The editorial soon mellowed into a reflection on high points of the relationship between America and China  such as U.S. President Richard Nixon’s opening to China  and even took some credit for helping President Ronald Reagan put the Soviet Union out of business.        The Global Times then reiterated Beijing’s standard line about how soft  democratic America stands no chance against authoritarian China in a trade war and positioned Beijing as the more mature player in a conflict Washington has not yet realized it cannot win:        The US  in fact  has limited leverage to contain China. A trade war will inevitably damage the US and is a stupid choice. It’s unrealistic to establish a NATO-style organization to target China. It is impossible to isolate and contain China given its expanding business overseas and domestic markets.        It’s difficult for the White House and Congress to mobilize an anti-China campaign in US society. Gone are the days when the public was willing to take a plunge for the so-called national interest. As long as China keeps calm in the face of hysterical US political elites  the so-called Cold War will not take shape.        At such a time  China should play tai chi with the US. This is the unique strategic wisdom of the Chinese nation. We must make the US feel the pain of the trade war and not allow the US to act unscrupulously in the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits. But we must act in a calm way. China will continue to open up. A deteriorating outside world will not change that.        China is not the Soviet Union. The US cannot deal with China as it did with the Soviet Union.        That last line became a Chinese political mantra with blinding speed after Pence’s speech to the Hudson Institute was compared to Churchill’s Iron Curtain speech.        On Monday  the Global Times pronounced China hurt and confused by the “stinging” speech Pence delivered to the Hudson Institute  filled with accusations that were “vitriolic  ruthless  and delivered in terms considered far from decorous.”        This second editorial invoked the “Thucydides Trap ” which has become another common talking point for Chinese politicians. The Thucydides Trap is a theory that posits ruling powers almost always go to war with rising powers  usually to the regret of both nations  unless extraordinary efforts are made to avoid conflict.        Beijing’s interpretation of Thucydides is that America has a unique responsibility to welcome China as a new global superpower and refrain from protecting American dominance by attempting to “contain” China.        As far as the Chinese are concerned  they are already doing everything a rising power could possibly do to ameliorate the concerns of the aging world hegemon  and they cannot understand why the Trump administration suddenly decided to make a “U-turn” at the urging of “hardliners” and commence efforts to contain China.        The Global Times defended the ad China took out in the Des Moines Register in September  widely seen as a major reason for the Trump administration’s complaint about Chinese interference in U.S. elections.        “Where is the U.S.’ long-hailed freedom of the press?” a state-run newspaper from one of the world’s most aggressive authoritarian regimes risibly asked. In a similar vein  the Global Times portrayed China as merely seeking to defend itself from a “U.S.-initiated trade war ” as if China has not been manipulating markets and stealing technology for decades.        The Global Times concluded President Trump is beating up on China to goose Republican turnout for the midterm elections and distract from “the Russiagate scandal”:        The reason that the Trump administration deliberately chose this timing – when China-US trade tensions are ratcheting up – to deliver the inflammatory speech is the upcoming US midterm elections.        Trump knows that playing the China card is always the safest option. It cannot only divert domestic attention from the Russiagate scandal and shift the political pressure from the president but also incite ordinary voters.        These unfounded accusations show that the understanding and judgment of the Trump administration on Sino-US relations are unprofessional  shallow and indiscreet  which is most worrying. The worsening atmosphere toward China in the US not only affects American public’ opinion on the country but also endangers the safety and interests of Chinese in the US.        When the leader of a state accuses other countries at will  how can he justify his reputation to improve bilateral ties? Perhaps the Trump government needs to think about how to show respect to China before requesting China to respect the US.        The Chinese appear to know the American left is very receptive to theories that President Trump relies on populist appeals to xenophobia and is desperate to distract from the investigation into “Russian collusion” in the 2016 election. ]'"

       "'[ “Utterly messed up my life”: What Chinese people really think of the trade war        The Guardian By Echo HuangOctober 9  2018        China’s ardent determination to win the trade war might not have all the public support it would like.        Since the US and China entered a trade war in earnest this year  both sides have been going tit-for-tat with increasing tariffs on goods. The US has put new tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports  while China has done the same to $110 billion worth of US goods. And while China’s running out of US goods to keep the retaliation going  its strongest weapon in this “war of national fate” with the US is the spirit of the Chinese people  according to state media.       \"“The heroism of ‘being the first to show concern and the last to enjoy oneself’ has always run through Chinese blood  which also includes the spirit of ‘sacrificing one’s interest for the greater good of the public  ” said an opinion piece (link in Chinese) posted by the state-run People’s Daily on July 10. “Facing this ‘war of national fate ’ Chinese are deeply aware that ‘there’s no home without a country ’ so they are willing to bear temporary losses.”\"       That comment doesn’t acknowledge how painful the trade war could become for common people. Economists estimate that if the latest Chinese goods to be added to the trade war see tariffs go up to 25% next year  it could shave half a percentage point off China’s growth. Online  people are sharing how they’re experiencing the impacts so far  and worrying about what’s to come.        Stocks tumble  yuan devalues    On Monday (Oct.7)  the first day after the Golden Week holiday  Chinese stocks fell sharply. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.7%—its biggest single-day loss (paywall)  in more than three months. The stock tumble came a day after China’s central bank announced that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks for the fourth time this year—a move seen as trying to boost the economy by increasing liquidity amid the trade war. In general  China’s stock markets haven’t been (paywall) taking the trade war in stride.        “This has been a tough year for me. I haven’t received payments on several projects because of stock bursts ” wrote a user (link in Chinese) of social media platform Weibo  who identified himself as working at a securities firm in Beijing. “The stock market’s tumble and the trade war have killed many projects. When I returned home  the village officials asked me how’s my work so far this year. My answer  sadly  was this—deleveraging  bad stock performance  and the trade war have utterly messed up my life.”        REUTERS/MARIANA BAZO    Looking for new markets.    The devalued yuan has also worried many. While it could help exporters by making their goods more competitive  it makes life tougher for people who need foreign currency  for example families of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese studying abroad.        “We are now kneeling to the trade war. It’s hard to see that the RMB [renminbi] can be stable in the near term. Looks like the Great Depression is going to arrive ” said a Weibo comment (link in Chinese).        Snacks  oil prices up    Treats are suddenly more expensive due to tariffs  and so are daily necessities.        “I ran out of nuts yesterday and wanted to top up my stock ” wrote a female user (link in Chinese) based in northern Hebei province  but she found the nuts she’s used to eating every day  including pecans  commonly sourced from the US  cost her more.        “I asked the shop owner  ‘Why is it more expensive than last time?’ The owner said it’s because of the trade war ” she continued  “And I asked him  ‘What’s the relationship?’ He said that he had imported lots of the nuts from overseas. This is the first time I feel the impact of the trade war.”        As for Maine lobster  forget about it.        Chinese drivers are also feeling the pinch  with China putting tariffs on US oil imports in August.        “I’ve deeply felt that the economic environment is not good. This year  there’s peer-to-peer lending and illegal money-raising crackdown  which also bled out a bunch of people. Now the drop has come to the real estate market…. then there’s the trade war  and oil prices keep going up. It won’t be long before I can’t afford to run my car ” wrote a user (link in Chinese).        Small businesses may be harder hit than larger ones. The most recent Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index  a better gauge of sentiment at smaller  private firms than the official manufacturing PMI  declined from 50.6 in August to 50 last month  the lowest level in more than a year. A number below 50 indicates a contraction.        REUTERS    In response to US tariffs  China has put tariffs on American soybean imports.    Pessimism about the new NAFTA    People aren’t optimistic the pressure on China’s economy will ease up. In fact  the new North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiated by the US  Mexico  and Canada—now with a brand-new acronym—shows the formation of a front against China  some online commenters noted.        “Why is the Chinese economy going to be difficult in the next six months?” wrote a male user (link in Chinese) of micro-blogging site Weibo  based in China’s southwestern Sichuan province. His argument that the elements that have been key to driving China’s economic growth in recent years—including infrastructure  foreign trade  and domestic demands—have all shown worrying signs.         “In terms of foreign trade  this is the most worrying ” he wrote. “The Americans are launching trade wars worldwide because they want to bypass the WTO [World Trade Organization] and build something new. At the end of September  the US  Canada and Mexico signed a new cooperation agreement. The agreement said if a ‘non-market-oriented economy‘ wants to enter their market  it needs the approval of all the three countries… Everyone knows who this ‘non-market-oriented economy’ is.”        (The new NAFTA asks countries in the agreement to notify each other if they are to have trade deal talks with a “non-market” economy  and also give one another a say in the deal.)        “Americans have been building an anti-China circle. In the first round  the Mexico gave in  then Canada. I am afraid that the third round is Japan  then Europe ” said another (link in Chinese). “I highly suggest that China should make major adjustments to its current policies instead of listening to the opinions from so-called elites.”China won’t back down in trade war with US: commerce minister        SCMP Amanda Lee        China will not cave in to US demands even if it faces further tariffs on its exports  China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan has said  signalling Beijing’s uncompromising stance in dealing with US.        “There is a view in the US that so long as the US keeps increasing tariffs  China will back down. They don’t know the history and culture of China ” Zhong said  in a statement published by Bloomberg News.        “This unyielding nation suffered foreign bullying for many times in history  but never succumbed to it even in the most difficult conditions. China doesn’t want a trade war  but would rise up to it should it break out.        “The US should not underestimate China’s resolve and will.”            This is Beijing’s strongest response yet to the trade war following a release of a white paper last month detailing its stance on the trade war  in which China blamed the US for creating the tensions and painted itself as a promoter of free trade.        The strong comments from Zhong  whose ministry is in the front line of any possible talks with the US  coincide with a rapid deterioration in the ties between Beijing and Washington.        Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage ofCHINA’S COMMERCE MINISTER ZHONG SHAN    US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  on a brief visit to Beijing on Monday  had a testy exchange with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.        Wang told Pompeo the US had hurt “mutual trust” and must stop “misguided actions” against China  while Pompeo said there were “fundamental disagreements” between the two powers.        Prospects for Beijing and Washington to de-escalate their trade tensions are not bright.        The two sides have locked horns in levying punitive tariffs against each other and there are gaping differences over a slew of issues from intellectual property rights to the role of state-owned enterprises.            The US initially imposed a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion worth of Chinese imports  and in September added a 10 per cent tariff on an additional US$200 billion of Chinese products  with the tariff rate set to rise to 25 per cent on January 1 if China does not make trade concessions.        China’s central bank to pump US$110 billion into economy as US trade war intensifies    US President Donald Trump has also threatened to extend punitive tariffs to all Chinese imports.        China retaliated with a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion of US imports and variable tariffs of 5 per cent to 10 per cent on a further US$60 billion of US imports.        China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi (left) and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a testy exchange on Monday in Beijing. Photo: AP    Washington is demanding China change its trade practices of forcing US businesses to transfer technologies and of subsidising state-owned enterprises.        Zhong reiterated Beijing’s line that China does not steal technology from US firms.        “I want to emphasise that China’s laws and regulations do not contain any requirement for technology transfer and that companies’ purchases of technologies and patents are pure market behaviour ” he said.        “China’s economic development  and science and technological progress are owed to reform and opening up and the endeavours of the Chinese people.”        As US turns up heat on China  trade war moves beyond tariffs to new battlefronts    Zhong also argued that China never “took advantage of the US” even as the country ran a record trade surplus of US$31.05 billion with the US in August.        “If one side had been taken advantage of all the time  could such business relations have continued? Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage of ” Zhong said.        The conflict between the two countries has now gone beyond trade  with Trump’s accusations that China is attempting to interfere in the 2018 US midterm congressional elections. Vice-President Mike Pence also stepped up the attack by condemning Beijing for using “every tool at its disposal” to undermine the US political system.        Pence also warned American companies  including tech giant Alphabet  which owns Google  to disengage from China.Trump rips up the trade playbook to take on China        Donna Borak  CNN        Updated 1037 GMT (1837 HKT) October 9  2018        Bali  Indonesia (CNN)President Donald Trump wants a deal with China — just not anytime soon.        After announcing a revamped trade agreement with Canada and Mexico last week  Trump reeled off a list of other countries that he said had given in to US demands to hold talks or make a deal: South Korea  Japan  the European Union.    He scoffed at those \"babies out there\" who worried about the effects of tariffs  suggesting that \"we wouldn\\\\ t be talking about a deal\" with Canada and Mexico without his confrontational approach.    The trade war will hit US and Chinese growth next year  the IMF warns    \"That\\\\ s going to embolden him to impose more tariffs and threaten more in the hopes of getting a better deal out of China \" said Edward Alden  a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.   \"Trump s no-holds-barred strategy on China is likely take center stage this week at a summit of global finance chiefs and central bankers in Bali  Indonesia. And it ll be up to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  the president s top economic envoy  to argue the US case as warnings intensify about the damage a protracted trade war could do to global economic growth.\"   \"The stakes are high \" Christine Lagarde  the managing director of the International Monetary Fund  said last week. \"We need to work together to de-escalate and resolve the current trade disputes.\"   \" Coalition of the willing \"  \"If the Trump administration can get the European Union and Japan on side following the recent trade deals with South Korea  Canada and Mexico  that s likely to strengthen the US negotiating position with Beijing  top administration officials argue.\"   US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA        US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA 01:58    \"We are talking to the European Union again  we are talking to Japan again  and we are moving to what I have characterized as a trade coalition of the willing to confront China \" Larry Kudlow  Trump\\\\ s chief economic adviser  said last week.   \"But talks with Europe and Japan are still in the early stages. And French President Emmanuel Macron said last month that Europe shouldn t sign trade deals with any country that doesn t comply with the Paris Agreement on climate change  a clear reference to the United States.\"  \"The Trump administration s approach to building a coalition against Beijing is a break from the old playbook of working collaboratively with allies to address mutual concerns.\"   Other big economies like the European Union and Japan share some of the main US grievances with China  including intellectual property theft and pressure on foreign companies to hand over technology to Chinese partners. But Trump slapped tariffs on key allies at the same time as stepping up his campaign against China  which some analysts suggest has weakened any potential united front.    The Trump administration has imposed new tariffs on about half of China&#39;s annual goods exports to the United States.    Souring relationship   \"Trump has made clear he s in no rush to restart talks with Beijing anytime soon. Instead  he has threatened to impose an even bigger wave of tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese products. That would mean the US measures effectively cover all the goods China sells to the United States each year.\"   \"I\\\\ m using them to negotiate \" Trump said of the tariffs. \"And hopefully  we can make a great deal with China — a fair deal and a reciprocal deal.\"    Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Details of the revised pact with Canada and Mexico  which is set to replace NAFTA  show that the US government is also trying other ways to amplify the pressure on China.    Tucked in the new agreement is a requirement that each country inform the others if it wants to start free trade negotiations with a \"non-market economy \" a clear reference to China. The other countries would also be able to review any potential free trade deal with China.    That move has upset Beijing  further souring the relationship between the two economic superpowers.    In a frank exchange of views in Beijing on Monday  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the United States should immediately stop its \"wrong remarks and actions \" including the trade war. Pompeo responded that the two countries have a \"fundamental disagreement\" and that the United States has \"great concerns about actions that China has taken.\"   \" How much pain are they willing to endure? \"   Neither side is showing signs of backing down.   \"The United States  whose economy relies less on exports than China s  is faring better so far. China s economy had already started slowing down this year and its stock markets and currency have slumped as the trade conflict has escalated.\"   China is pumping more cash into its economy as the trade war heats up    \"The question is: How much pain are they willing to endure?\" said Thomas Bernes  a distinguished fellow for the Centre for International Governance Innovation. \"They will be looking to the midterm elections to see if there is going to be a rejection of Trumpism or whether they he gains strength and remains in power.\"    For its part  the Trump administration appears willing to maintain the pressure for as long as it can.    \"We have changed the paradigm \" US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said last month. \"We have tariffs in place  and the president is not going to let this go along when you have forced transfer of intellectual property.\"    Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires at the end of November.    But with Beijing unwilling to give ground on US demands that it change fundamental parts of its economic policy  the prospects of reaching a deal anytime soon appear slim.    \"It is still hard to see how a further escalation of the trade conflict with China will be avoided \" Andrew Hunter  US economist at research firm Capital Economics said in a note to clients last week.Is China or Russia America’s Defining Rival?    The debate doesn’t just have consequences for U.S. foreign policy—it will define the next decades of domestic affairs as well.        OCT 9  2018        Late last week  as most of America’s political class was transfixed by the denouement of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle  Vice President Mike Pence gave a wide-ranging address on the U.S. relationship with China  and why the Trump administration is committed to opposing its expansionist designs. For the most part  it was a familiar litany of complaints about China’s efforts to coerce its neighbors in the western Pacific  its trade abuses  its hostility to religious freedom  and its support of unsavory regimes around the world. Yet halfway through his remarks  the vice president shifted his emphasis  turning from all the various ways the Chinese party-state was acting in the world outside America’s borders to how it was seeking to influence political and cultural life inside them.        Specifically  Pence warned that “China wants a different American president ” and that Beijing was mobilizing “covert actors  front groups  and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policies” to that end. By now  it has become routine for the heads of U.S. multinationals to condemn the Trump administration’s trade policies  and the fact that they’d do so is perfectly understandable. China’s violent labor repression and its policy of subsidizing industrialists at the expense of households have proved highly advantageous to those seeking a disciplined and relatively low-cost workforce  regardless of their citizenship. According to Pence  however  there is another layer to the politics of trade  namely that senior Chinese officials are threatening to punish business leaders who fail to denounce U.S. tariffs. He pointed to the rising sophistication with which Beijing exploits America’s domestic political cleavages  as evidenced by its targeting of retaliatory tariffs to regions and industries believed crucial to the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections  and its shrewd efforts to silence criticism of Chinese policies on university campuses desperate for Chinese money.

Some observers have dismissed the idea  warning that it represents a distraction from ongoing Russian meddling. Others acknowledge that while China’s efforts to influence democratic outcomes are different in character from Russia’s approach  which Beijing seems to see as “ineffective and counterproductive ” there is no question that  as Rush Doshi and Robert D. Williams of the Brookings Institution have cautiously observed  “China has long pursued a wide-ranging and very real campaign to influence the political and informational environment of other countries  including the United States.”        Needless to say  one could see both Russia and China as dangerous rivals  and I certainly do. But in an age of intensifying partisan enmity  when large numbers of Americans question the legitimacy of the Trump presidency while similarly large numbers see Donald Trump as their champion  it is fitting that Democrats and Republicans can’t bring themselves to agree on which of the world’s revanchist powers ought to serve as what you might call our orienting enemy or  as the Harvard political scientist Samuel P. Huntington once put it  the “other” that gives our grand strategy its ideological shape.        In 1997  not long after the collapse of the Soviet bloc  Huntington warned that American grand strategy was losing its coherence in part because America’s creedal identity had long been defined in opposition to just such an “other.” In the early days of the republic  he observed  it was Britain that offered this necessary contrast: While the British lived under tyranny and hierarchy  Americans told themselves  we enjoyed freedom and equality. So  too  in later years did Wilhelmine Germany provide an orienting rivalry  and then the Nazi and Soviet totalitarianisms that ravaged the world for much of the 20th century. The Soviet Union’s demise therefore prompted a kind of identity crisis. “While wars at times may have a divisive effect on society ” wrote Huntington  “a common enemy can often help to promote identity and cohesion among people. The weakening or absence of a common enemy can do just the reverse.”        What Huntington did not quite anticipate is that America would find itself divided between two creedal identities—one right  one left—each of which defines itself against a different enemy. This is a pattern that has obtained in earlier eras. Consider that the founding generation was bitterly divided over whether Revolutionary France or the British Empire represented the greater threat to American liberty. The early 1900s saw debates between Germanophiles  many of whom were progressives and socialists of German extraction  and Anglophiles who embraced the idea of a world order jointly administered by a British-American condominium. The difference now is that even in the supposed twilight of American global leadership  our creedal clashes reverberate around the world.        And so the United States finds itself in the midst of not one but two cold wars. To cosmopolitan liberals  it is Russia that serves as America’s chief geopolitical adversary. Even in Russia’s weakened and impoverished state  they fear the deftness with which its operatives act in connivance with illiberal elements in the world’s diverse market democracies to undermine them from within. Nationalist conservatives see rising Chinese power as the far graver threat to American interests  and they are increasingly open to wielding the power of the state to resist and counter Beijing’s depredations  despite the cost to economic freedom that may well result.        It is not difficult to understand why Russia has such a hold on the liberal imagination. There is at this point little doubt that the Russian state has sought to sow chaos and division in the U.S. and democratic Europe  in part out of a conviction that Western liberals have done much the same throughout post-Soviet Eurasia. Though the extent to which Russian information operations influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election is contested  the notion that it played a decisive role is an article of faith among Trump’s liberal critics  for whom Vladimir Putin is the perfect foil.        The Putin ascendancy has been defined by  in the first place  rank kleptocracy  but also by an explicit and often deranged antiliberalism  in which the chief enemies of the Russian nation are the forces of gay rights and feminism. As the American author Timothy Snyder has argued  Putinism’s crusade against gay rights was designed “to transform demands for democracy into a nebulous threat to Russian innocence: voting = west = sodomy.” While defining liberalism as the politics of sexual perversion  Putin defines his own regime as the defender of masculinity and traditionalism  and as the natural ally of all those who defend state sovereignty against the supposed cosmopolitan conspiracy to dissolve the natural family. In short  Putin invites cosmopolitan liberals to see Russia under his rule as their enemy  just as he invites right-wing populists in the Western democracies to see him as a friend.        An America that defines itself against Putin’s Russia is an America that would redouble its commitment to cosmopolitan liberalism  including a commitment to free and open trade on a multilateral  nondiscriminatory basis  while marginalizing nationalist conservatism as retrograde. nato would be shored up  which is all to the good  but the U.S. would adopt a warier attitude toward populist parties in Central and Eastern Europe  a stance that could see these democracies drift further out of the American orbit.        And as for the Chinese party-state  it wouldn’t exactly be a friend  especially in light of its hostility to civil liberties  but the Chinese Communist Party’s stated commitment to combating climate change and antitrade nationalist politicians would lend it a certain prestige and legitimacy. Shortly after Trump’s inauguration  Xi Jinping presented himself as a defender of a rules-based international order  the Paris agreement  and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran  and in doing so he won himself admirers in elite circles  especially among those unaware of the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims for political crimes. Over time  a U.S. grand strategy rooted in cosmopolitan liberalism might grow warier of Chinese power  especially if the Chinese party-state were to become more explicitly nationalist as it sees less of a need to cater to cosmopolitan-liberal sensibilities  as seems likely. But by then the economic integration of the Western democracies with China might be irreversible  and Beijing would have the upper hand.        What would it mean for the U.S. to instead choose China as its “other ” as nationalist conservatives would have it? One early indication comes from a recent report from the Department of Defense  which details America’s growing dependence on China’s manufacturing base  and the threat this poses to the country’s war-fighting capabilities. In the 1990s and 2000s  market conservatives could point to the Soviet collapse as an indictment of statism  and to global economic integration as an unambiguous good. Many of these market conservatives now find themselves making common cause with cosmopolitan liberals while nationalist conservatives rethink their commitment to laissez-faire  with an eye toward meeting the challenge posed by a Chinese party-state that sees industrial progress as central to its strategic ambitions. If Beijing  not Moscow  is public enemy No. 1  it is vital that the U.S. boost public investment in infrastructure and human capital  and that it steer U.S. firms to build resilient supply chains based in the Americas  not in China’s industrial heartland. Russia would still be a rival  I suspect  but it would be seen through a different lens: as a potential ally in the protracted conflict with China  as would become much clearer once Putin himself exits the scene.        Culturally  choosing China as an orienting enemy would have more ambiguous effects. One can imagine a xenophobic turn against Chinese immigrants  visitors  and students  which would have ugly consequences. Yet one can also imagine an embrace of the Chinese people on the grounds that Beijing’s authoritarianism serves a narrow elite more than it serves ordinary workers. The argument  in essence  would be that the U.S. stands against the party-state  not China as a whole  and that America would welcome a more just and inclusive Chinese government. Indeed  Pence made exactly this argument in his recent address. More broadly  an America waging a cold war on China might place a somewhat greater emphasis on cohesion and solidarity over cosmopolitanism  not least because disentangling the American and Chinese economies would entail considerable sacrifice on the part of the U.S. business elite—a sacrifice that would have to be justified in solidaristic terms.        Which enemy will we choose in the years to come? Which cold war will we wage most assiduously? The answer will depend in no small part on the outcome of the elections to come. If history is any guide  the stakes are high  and the consequences will be enduring.Chinese Media Vow to Fight Against ‘Insult’ from Pence  Threaten ‘Cold War’        8 Oct 2018        China’s state-run Global Times vowed over the weekend to fight back against “insults” from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and promised a “new Cold War” if the Trump administration forces the issue by continuing to produce “hostile reports and speeches.”    The Global Times took a passive-aggressive approach in an editorial on Sunday  beginning with strong criticism of Pence’s speech at the Hudson Institute last Thursday and citing observers who compared it to Sir Winston Churchill’s “Iron Curtain” speech about the Soviet Union at the dawn of the Cold War.        The editorial soon mellowed into a reflection on high points of the relationship between America and China  such as U.S. President Richard Nixon’s opening to China  and even took some credit for helping President Ronald Reagan put the Soviet Union out of business.        The Global Times then reiterated Beijing’s standard line about how soft  democratic America stands no chance against authoritarian China in a trade war and positioned Beijing as the more mature player in a conflict Washington has not yet realized it cannot win:        The US  in fact  has limited leverage to contain China. A trade war will inevitably damage the US and is a stupid choice. It’s unrealistic to establish a NATO-style organization to target China. It is impossible to isolate and contain China given its expanding business overseas and domestic markets.        It’s difficult for the White House and Congress to mobilize an anti-China campaign in US society. Gone are the days when the public was willing to take a plunge for the so-called national interest. As long as China keeps calm in the face of hysterical US political elites  the so-called Cold War will not take shape.        At such a time  China should play tai chi with the US. This is the unique strategic wisdom of the Chinese nation. We must make the US feel the pain of the trade war and not allow the US to act unscrupulously in the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits. But we must act in a calm way. China will continue to open up. A deteriorating outside world will not change that.        China is not the Soviet Union. The US cannot deal with China as it did with the Soviet Union.        That last line became a Chinese political mantra with blinding speed after Pence’s speech to the Hudson Institute was compared to Churchill’s Iron Curtain speech.        On Monday  the Global Times pronounced China hurt and confused by the “stinging” speech Pence delivered to the Hudson Institute  filled with accusations that were “vitriolic  ruthless  and delivered in terms considered far from decorous.”        This second editorial invoked the “Thucydides Trap ” which has become another common talking point for Chinese politicians. The Thucydides Trap is a theory that posits ruling powers almost always go to war with rising powers  usually to the regret of both nations  unless extraordinary efforts are made to avoid conflict.        Beijing’s interpretation of Thucydides is that America has a unique responsibility to welcome China as a new global superpower and refrain from protecting American dominance by attempting to “contain” China.        As far as the Chinese are concerned  they are already doing everything a rising power could possibly do to ameliorate the concerns of the aging world hegemon  and they cannot understand why the Trump administration suddenly decided to make a “U-turn” at the urging of “hardliners” and commence efforts to contain China.        The Global Times defended the ad China took out in the Des Moines Register in September  widely seen as a major reason for the Trump administration’s complaint about Chinese interference in U.S. elections.        “Where is the U.S.’ long-hailed freedom of the press?” a state-run newspaper from one of the world’s most aggressive authoritarian regimes risibly asked. In a similar vein  the Global Times portrayed China as merely seeking to defend itself from a “U.S.-initiated trade war ” as if China has not been manipulating markets and stealing technology for decades.        The Global Times concluded President Trump is beating up on China to goose Republican turnout for the midterm elections and distract from “the Russiagate scandal”:        The reason that the Trump administration deliberately chose this timing – when China-US trade tensions are ratcheting up – to deliver the inflammatory speech is the upcoming US midterm elections.        Trump knows that playing the China card is always the safest option. It cannot only divert domestic attention from the Russiagate scandal and shift the political pressure from the president but also incite ordinary voters.        These unfounded accusations show that the understanding and judgment of the Trump administration on Sino-US relations are unprofessional  shallow and indiscreet  which is most worrying. The worsening atmosphere toward China in the US not only affects American public’ opinion on the country but also endangers the safety and interests of Chinese in the US.        When the leader of a state accuses other countries at will  how can he justify his reputation to improve bilateral ties? Perhaps the Trump government needs to think about how to show respect to China before requesting China to respect the US.        The Chinese appear to know the American left is very receptive to theories that President Trump relies on populist appeals to xenophobia and is desperate to distract from the investigation into “Russian collusion” in the 2016 election.“Utterly messed up my life”: What Chinese people really think of the trade war        The Guardian By Echo HuangOctober 9  2018        China’s ardent determination to win the trade war might not have all the public support it would like.        Since the US and China entered a trade war in earnest this year  both sides have been going tit-for-tat with increasing tariffs on goods. The US has put new tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports  while China has done the same to $110 billion worth of US goods. And while China’s running out of US goods to keep the retaliation going  its strongest weapon in this “war of national fate” with the US is the spirit of the Chinese people  according to state media.       \"“The heroism of ‘being the first to show concern and the last to enjoy oneself’ has always run through Chinese blood  which also includes the spirit of ‘sacrificing one’s interest for the greater good of the public  ” said an opinion piece (link in Chinese) posted by the state-run People’s Daily on July 10. “Facing this ‘war of national fate ’ Chinese are deeply aware that ‘there’s no home without a country ’ so they are willing to bear temporary losses.”\"       That comment doesn’t acknowledge how painful the trade war could become for common people. Economists estimate that if the latest Chinese goods to be added to the trade war see tariffs go up to 25% next year  it could shave half a percentage point off China’s growth. Online  people are sharing how they’re experiencing the impacts so far  and worrying about what’s to come.        Stocks tumble  yuan devalues    On Monday (Oct.7)  the first day after the Golden Week holiday  Chinese stocks fell sharply. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.7%—its biggest single-day loss (paywall)  in more than three months. The stock tumble came a day after China’s central bank announced that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks for the fourth time this year—a move seen as trying to boost the economy by increasing liquidity amid the trade war. In general  China’s stock markets haven’t been (paywall) taking the trade war in stride.        “This has been a tough year for me. I haven’t received payments on several projects because of stock bursts ” wrote a user (link in Chinese) of social media platform Weibo  who identified himself as working at a securities firm in Beijing. “The stock market’s tumble and the trade war have killed many projects. When I returned home  the village officials asked me how’s my work so far this year. My answer  sadly  was this—deleveraging  bad stock performance  and the trade war have utterly messed up my life.”        REUTERS/MARIANA BAZO    Looking for new markets.    The devalued yuan has also worried many. While it could help exporters by making their goods more competitive  it makes life tougher for people who need foreign currency  for example families of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese studying abroad.        “We are now kneeling to the trade war. It’s hard to see that the RMB [renminbi] can be stable in the near term. Looks like the Great Depression is going to arrive ” said a Weibo comment (link in Chinese).        Snacks  oil prices up    Treats are suddenly more expensive due to tariffs  and so are daily necessities.        “I ran out of nuts yesterday and wanted to top up my stock ” wrote a female user (link in Chinese) based in northern Hebei province  but she found the nuts she’s used to eating every day  including pecans  commonly sourced from the US  cost her more.        “I asked the shop owner  ‘Why is it more expensive than last time?’ The owner said it’s because of the trade war ” she continued  “And I asked him  ‘What’s the relationship?’ He said that he had imported lots of the nuts from overseas. This is the first time I feel the impact of the trade war.”        As for Maine lobster  forget about it.        Chinese drivers are also feeling the pinch  with China putting tariffs on US oil imports in August.        “I’ve deeply felt that the economic environment is not good. This year  there’s peer-to-peer lending and illegal money-raising crackdown  which also bled out a bunch of people. Now the drop has come to the real estate market…. then there’s the trade war  and oil prices keep going up. It won’t be long before I can’t afford to run my car ” wrote a user (link in Chinese).        Small businesses may be harder hit than larger ones. The most recent Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index  a better gauge of sentiment at smaller  private firms than the official manufacturing PMI  declined from 50.6 in August to 50 last month  the lowest level in more than a year. A number below 50 indicates a contraction.        REUTERS    In response to US tariffs  China has put tariffs on American soybean imports.    Pessimism about the new NAFTA    People aren’t optimistic the pressure on China’s economy will ease up. In fact  the new North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiated by the US  Mexico  and Canada—now with a brand-new acronym—shows the formation of a front against China  some online commenters noted.        “Why is the Chinese economy going to be difficult in the next six months?” wrote a male user (link in Chinese) of micro-blogging site Weibo  based in China’s southwestern Sichuan province. His argument that the elements that have been key to driving China’s economic growth in recent years—including infrastructure  foreign trade  and domestic demands—have all shown worrying signs.         “In terms of foreign trade  this is the most worrying ” he wrote. “The Americans are launching trade wars worldwide because they want to bypass the WTO [World Trade Organization] and build something new. At the end of September  the US  Canada and Mexico signed a new cooperation agreement. The agreement said if a ‘non-market-oriented economy‘ wants to enter their market  it needs the approval of all the three countries… Everyone knows who this ‘non-market-oriented economy’ is.”        (The new NAFTA asks countries in the agreement to notify each other if they are to have trade deal talks with a “non-market” economy  and also give one another a say in the deal.)        “Americans have been building an anti-China circle. In the first round  the Mexico gave in  then Canada. I am afraid that the third round is Japan  then Europe ” said another (link in Chinese). “I highly suggest that China should make major adjustments to its current policies instead of listening to the opinions from so-called elites.”China won’t back down in trade war with US: commerce minister        SCMP Amanda Lee        China will not cave in to US demands even if it faces further tariffs on its exports  China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan has said  signalling Beijing’s uncompromising stance in dealing with US.        “There is a view in the US that so long as the US keeps increasing tariffs  China will back down. They don’t know the history and culture of China ” Zhong said  in a statement published by Bloomberg News.        “This unyielding nation suffered foreign bullying for many times in history  but never succumbed to it even in the most difficult conditions. China doesn’t want a trade war  but would rise up to it should it break out.        “The US should not underestimate China’s resolve and will.”            This is Beijing’s strongest response yet to the trade war following a release of a white paper last month detailing its stance on the trade war  in which China blamed the US for creating the tensions and painted itself as a promoter of free trade.        The strong comments from Zhong  whose ministry is in the front line of any possible talks with the US  coincide with a rapid deterioration in the ties between Beijing and Washington.        Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage ofCHINA’S COMMERCE MINISTER ZHONG SHAN    US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  on a brief visit to Beijing on Monday  had a testy exchange with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.        Wang told Pompeo the US had hurt “mutual trust” and must stop “misguided actions” against China  while Pompeo said there were “fundamental disagreements” between the two powers.        Prospects for Beijing and Washington to de-escalate their trade tensions are not bright.        The two sides have locked horns in levying punitive tariffs against each other and there are gaping differences over a slew of issues from intellectual property rights to the role of state-owned enterprises.            The US initially imposed a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion worth of Chinese imports  and in September added a 10 per cent tariff on an additional US$200 billion of Chinese products  with the tariff rate set to rise to 25 per cent on January 1 if China does not make trade concessions.        China’s central bank to pump US$110 billion into economy as US trade war intensifies    US President Donald Trump has also threatened to extend punitive tariffs to all Chinese imports.        China retaliated with a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion of US imports and variable tariffs of 5 per cent to 10 per cent on a further US$60 billion of US imports.        China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi (left) and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a testy exchange on Monday in Beijing. Photo: AP    Washington is demanding China change its trade practices of forcing US businesses to transfer technologies and of subsidising state-owned enterprises.        Zhong reiterated Beijing’s line that China does not steal technology from US firms.        “I want to emphasise that China’s laws and regulations do not contain any requirement for technology transfer and that companies’ purchases of technologies and patents are pure market behaviour ” he said.        “China’s economic development  and science and technological progress are owed to reform and opening up and the endeavours of the Chinese people.”        As US turns up heat on China  trade war moves beyond tariffs to new battlefronts    Zhong also argued that China never “took advantage of the US” even as the country ran a record trade surplus of US$31.05 billion with the US in August.        “If one side had been taken advantage of all the time  could such business relations have continued? Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage of ” Zhong said.        The conflict between the two countries has now gone beyond trade  with Trump’s accusations that China is attempting to interfere in the 2018 US midterm congressional elections. Vice-President Mike Pence also stepped up the attack by condemning Beijing for using “every tool at its disposal” to undermine the US political system.        Pence also warned American companies  including tech giant Alphabet  which owns Google  to disengage from China.Trump rips up the trade playbook to take on China        Donna Borak  CNN        Updated 1037 GMT (1837 HKT) October 9  2018        Bali  Indonesia (CNN)President Donald Trump wants a deal with China — just not anytime soon.        After announcing a revamped trade agreement with Canada and Mexico last week  Trump reeled off a list of other countries that he said had given in to US demands to hold talks or make a deal: South Korea  Japan  the European Union.    He scoffed at those \"babies out there\" who worried about the effects of tariffs  suggesting that \"we wouldn\\\\ t be talking about a deal\" with Canada and Mexico without his confrontational approach.    The trade war will hit US and Chinese growth next year  the IMF warns    \"That\\\\ s going to embolden him to impose more tariffs and threaten more in the hopes of getting a better deal out of China \" said Edward Alden  a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.   \"Trump s no-holds-barred strategy on China is likely take center stage this week at a summit of global finance chiefs and central bankers in Bali  Indonesia. And it ll be up to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  the president s top economic envoy  to argue the US case as warnings intensify about the damage a protracted trade war could do to global economic growth.\"   \"The stakes are high \" Christine Lagarde  the managing director of the International Monetary Fund  said last week. \"We need to work together to de-escalate and resolve the current trade disputes.\"   \" Coalition of the willing \"  \"If the Trump administration can get the European Union and Japan on side following the recent trade deals with South Korea  Canada and Mexico  that s likely to strengthen the US negotiating position with Beijing  top administration officials argue.\"   US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA        US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA 01:58    \"We are talking to the European Union again  we are talking to Japan again  and we are moving to what I have characterized as a trade coalition of the willing to confront China \" Larry Kudlow  Trump\\\\ s chief economic adviser  said last week.   \"But talks with Europe and Japan are still in the early stages. And French President Emmanuel Macron said last month that Europe shouldn t sign trade deals with any country that doesn t comply with the Paris Agreement on climate change  a clear reference to the United States.\"  \"The Trump administration s approach to building a coalition against Beijing is a break from the old playbook of working collaboratively with allies to address mutual concerns.\"   Other big economies like the European Union and Japan share some of the main US grievances with China  including intellectual property theft and pressure on foreign companies to hand over technology to Chinese partners. But Trump slapped tariffs on key allies at the same time as stepping up his campaign against China  which some analysts suggest has weakened any potential united front.    The Trump administration has imposed new tariffs on about half of China&#39;s annual goods exports to the United States.    Souring relationship   \"Trump has made clear he s in no rush to restart talks with Beijing anytime soon. Instead  he has threatened to impose an even bigger wave of tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese products. That would mean the US measures effectively cover all the goods China sells to the United States each year.\"   \"I\\\\ m using them to negotiate \" Trump said of the tariffs. \"And hopefully  we can make a great deal with China — a fair deal and a reciprocal deal.\"    Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Details of the revised pact with Canada and Mexico  which is set to replace NAFTA  show that the US government is also trying other ways to amplify the pressure on China.    Tucked in the new agreement is a requirement that each country inform the others if it wants to start free trade negotiations with a \"non-market economy \" a clear reference to China. The other countries would also be able to review any potential free trade deal with China.    That move has upset Beijing  further souring the relationship between the two economic superpowers.    In a frank exchange of views in Beijing on Monday  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the United States should immediately stop its \"wrong remarks and actions \" including the trade war. Pompeo responded that the two countries have a \"fundamental disagreement\" and that the United States has \"great concerns about actions that China has taken.\"   \" How much pain are they willing to endure? \"   Neither side is showing signs of backing down.   \"The United States  whose economy relies less on exports than China s  is faring better so far. China s economy had already started slowing down this year and its stock markets and currency have slumped as the trade conflict has escalated.\"   China is pumping more cash into its economy as the trade war heats up    \"The question is: How much pain are they willing to endure?\" said Thomas Bernes  a distinguished fellow for the Centre for International Governance Innovation. \"They will be looking to the midterm elections to see if there is going to be a rejection of Trumpism or whether they he gains strength and remains in power.\"    For its part  the Trump administration appears willing to maintain the pressure for as long as it can.    \"We have changed the paradigm \" US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said last month. \"We have tariffs in place  and the president is not going to let this go along when you have forced transfer of intellectual property.\"    Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires at the end of November.    But with Beijing unwilling to give ground on US demands that it change fundamental parts of its economic policy  the prospects of reaching a deal anytime soon appear slim.    \"It is still hard to see how a further escalation of the trade conflict with China will be avoided \" Andrew Hunter  US economist at research firm Capital Economics said in a note to clients last week.Is China or Russia America’s Defining Rival?    The debate doesn’t just have consequences for U.S. foreign policy—it will define the next decades of domestic affairs as well.        OCT 9  2018        Late last week  as most of America’s political class was transfixed by the denouement of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle  Vice President Mike Pence gave a wide-ranging address on the U.S. relationship with China  and why the Trump administration is committed to opposing its expansionist designs. For the most part  it was a familiar litany of complaints about China’s efforts to coerce its neighbors in the western Pacific  its trade abuses  its hostility to religious freedom  and its support of unsavory regimes around the world. Yet halfway through his remarks  the vice president shifted his emphasis  turning from all the various ways the Chinese party-state was acting in the world outside America’s borders to how it was seeking to influence political and cultural life inside them.        Specifically  Pence warned that “China wants a different American president ” and that Beijing was mobilizing “covert actors  front groups  and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policies” to that end. By now  it has become routine for the heads of U.S. multinationals to condemn the Trump administration’s trade policies  and the fact that they’d do so is perfectly understandable. China’s violent labor repression and its policy of subsidizing industrialists at the expense of households have proved highly advantageous to those seeking a disciplined and relatively low-cost workforce  regardless of their citizenship. According to Pence  however  there is another layer to the politics of trade  namely that senior Chinese officials are threatening to punish business leaders who fail to denounce U.S. tariffs. He pointed to the rising sophistication with which Beijing exploits America’s domestic political cleavages  as evidenced by its targeting of retaliatory tariffs to regions and industries believed crucial to the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections  and its shrewd efforts to silence criticism of Chinese policies on university campuses desperate for Chinese money.

Some observers have dismissed the idea  warning that it represents a distraction from ongoing Russian meddling. Others acknowledge that while China’s efforts to influence democratic outcomes are different in character from Russia’s approach  which Beijing seems to see as “ineffective and counterproductive ” there is no question that  as Rush Doshi and Robert D. Williams of the Brookings Institution have cautiously observed  “China has long pursued a wide-ranging and very real campaign to influence the political and informational environment of other countries  including the United States.”        Needless to say  one could see both Russia and China as dangerous rivals  and I certainly do. But in an age of intensifying partisan enmity  when large numbers of Americans question the legitimacy of the Trump presidency while similarly large numbers see Donald Trump as their champion  it is fitting that Democrats and Republicans can’t bring themselves to agree on which of the world’s revanchist powers ought to serve as what you might call our orienting enemy or  as the Harvard political scientist Samuel P. Huntington once put it  the “other” that gives our grand strategy its ideological shape.        In 1997  not long after the collapse of the Soviet bloc  Huntington warned that American grand strategy was losing its coherence in part because America’s creedal identity had long been defined in opposition to just such an “other.” In the early days of the republic  he observed  it was Britain that offered this necessary contrast: While the British lived under tyranny and hierarchy  Americans told themselves  we enjoyed freedom and equality. So  too  in later years did Wilhelmine Germany provide an orienting rivalry  and then the Nazi and Soviet totalitarianisms that ravaged the world for much of the 20th century. The Soviet Union’s demise therefore prompted a kind of identity crisis. “While wars at times may have a divisive effect on society ” wrote Huntington  “a common enemy can often help to promote identity and cohesion among people. The weakening or absence of a common enemy can do just the reverse.”        What Huntington did not quite anticipate is that America would find itself divided between two creedal identities—one right  one left—each of which defines itself against a different enemy. This is a pattern that has obtained in earlier eras. Consider that the founding generation was bitterly divided over whether Revolutionary France or the British Empire represented the greater threat to American liberty. The early 1900s saw debates between Germanophiles  many of whom were progressives and socialists of German extraction  and Anglophiles who embraced the idea of a world order jointly administered by a British-American condominium. The difference now is that even in the supposed twilight of American global leadership  our creedal clashes reverberate around the world.        And so the United States finds itself in the midst of not one but two cold wars. To cosmopolitan liberals  it is Russia that serves as America’s chief geopolitical adversary. Even in Russia’s weakened and impoverished state  they fear the deftness with which its operatives act in connivance with illiberal elements in the world’s diverse market democracies to undermine them from within. Nationalist conservatives see rising Chinese power as the far graver threat to American interests  and they are increasingly open to wielding the power of the state to resist and counter Beijing’s depredations  despite the cost to economic freedom that may well result.        It is not difficult to understand why Russia has such a hold on the liberal imagination. There is at this point little doubt that the Russian state has sought to sow chaos and division in the U.S. and democratic Europe  in part out of a conviction that Western liberals have done much the same throughout post-Soviet Eurasia. Though the extent to which Russian information operations influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election is contested  the notion that it played a decisive role is an article of faith among Trump’s liberal critics  for whom Vladimir Putin is the perfect foil.        The Putin ascendancy has been defined by  in the first place  rank kleptocracy  but also by an explicit and often deranged antiliberalism  in which the chief enemies of the Russian nation are the forces of gay rights and feminism. As the American author Timothy Snyder has argued  Putinism’s crusade against gay rights was designed “to transform demands for democracy into a nebulous threat to Russian innocence: voting = west = sodomy.” While defining liberalism as the politics of sexual perversion  Putin defines his own regime as the defender of masculinity and traditionalism  and as the natural ally of all those who defend state sovereignty against the supposed cosmopolitan conspiracy to dissolve the natural family. In short  Putin invites cosmopolitan liberals to see Russia under his rule as their enemy  just as he invites right-wing populists in the Western democracies to see him as a friend.        An America that defines itself against Putin’s Russia is an America that would redouble its commitment to cosmopolitan liberalism  including a commitment to free and open trade on a multilateral  nondiscriminatory basis  while marginalizing nationalist conservatism as retrograde. nato would be shored up  which is all to the good  but the U.S. would adopt a warier attitude toward populist parties in Central and Eastern Europe  a stance that could see these democracies drift further out of the American orbit.        And as for the Chinese party-state  it wouldn’t exactly be a friend  especially in light of its hostility to civil liberties  but the Chinese Communist Party’s stated commitment to combating climate change and antitrade nationalist politicians would lend it a certain prestige and legitimacy. Shortly after Trump’s inauguration  Xi Jinping presented himself as a defender of a rules-based international order  the Paris agreement  and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran  and in doing so he won himself admirers in elite circles  especially among those unaware of the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims for political crimes. Over time  a U.S. grand strategy rooted in cosmopolitan liberalism might grow warier of Chinese power  especially if the Chinese party-state were to become more explicitly nationalist as it sees less of a need to cater to cosmopolitan-liberal sensibilities  as seems likely. But by then the economic integration of the Western democracies with China might be irreversible  and Beijing would have the upper hand.        What would it mean for the U.S. to instead choose China as its “other ” as nationalist conservatives would have it? One early indication comes from a recent report from the Department of Defense  which details America’s growing dependence on China’s manufacturing base  and the threat this poses to the country’s war-fighting capabilities. In the 1990s and 2000s  market conservatives could point to the Soviet collapse as an indictment of statism  and to global economic integration as an unambiguous good. Many of these market conservatives now find themselves making common cause with cosmopolitan liberals while nationalist conservatives rethink their commitment to laissez-faire  with an eye toward meeting the challenge posed by a Chinese party-state that sees industrial progress as central to its strategic ambitions. If Beijing  not Moscow  is public enemy No. 1  it is vital that the U.S. boost public investment in infrastructure and human capital  and that it steer U.S. firms to build resilient supply chains based in the Americas  not in China’s industrial heartland. Russia would still be a rival  I suspect  but it would be seen through a different lens: as a potential ally in the protracted conflict with China  as would become much clearer once Putin himself exits the scene.        Culturally  choosing China as an orienting enemy would have more ambiguous effects. One can imagine a xenophobic turn against Chinese immigrants  visitors  and students  which would have ugly consequences. Yet one can also imagine an embrace of the Chinese people on the grounds that Beijing’s authoritarianism serves a narrow elite more than it serves ordinary workers. The argument  in essence  would be that the U.S. stands against the party-state  not China as a whole  and that America would welcome a more just and inclusive Chinese government. Indeed  Pence made exactly this argument in his recent address. More broadly  an America waging a cold war on China might place a somewhat greater emphasis on cohesion and solidarity over cosmopolitanism  not least because disentangling the American and Chinese economies would entail considerable sacrifice on the part of the U.S. business elite—a sacrifice that would have to be justified in solidaristic terms.        Which enemy will we choose in the years to come? Which cold war will we wage most assiduously? The answer will depend in no small part on the outcome of the elections to come. If history is any guide  the stakes are high  and the consequences will be enduring.Chinese Media Vow to Fight Against ‘Insult’ from Pence  Threaten ‘Cold War’        8 Oct 2018        China’s state-run Global Times vowed over the weekend to fight back against “insults” from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and promised a “new Cold War” if the Trump administration forces the issue by continuing to produce “hostile reports and speeches.”    The Global Times took a passive-aggressive approach in an editorial on Sunday  beginning with strong criticism of Pence’s speech at the Hudson Institute last Thursday and citing observers who compared it to Sir Winston Churchill’s “Iron Curtain” speech about the Soviet Union at the dawn of the Cold War.        The editorial soon mellowed into a reflection on high points of the relationship between America and China  such as U.S. President Richard Nixon’s opening to China  and even took some credit for helping President Ronald Reagan put the Soviet Union out of business.        The Global Times then reiterated Beijing’s standard line about how soft  democratic America stands no chance against authoritarian China in a trade war and positioned Beijing as the more mature player in a conflict Washington has not yet realized it cannot win:        The US  in fact  has limited leverage to contain China. A trade war will inevitably damage the US and is a stupid choice. It’s unrealistic to establish a NATO-style organization to target China. It is impossible to isolate and contain China given its expanding business overseas and domestic markets.        It’s difficult for the White House and Congress to mobilize an anti-China campaign in US society. Gone are the days when the public was willing to take a plunge for the so-called national interest. As long as China keeps calm in the face of hysterical US political elites  the so-called Cold War will not take shape.        At such a time  China should play tai chi with the US. This is the unique strategic wisdom of the Chinese nation. We must make the US feel the pain of the trade war and not allow the US to act unscrupulously in the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits. But we must act in a calm way. China will continue to open up. A deteriorating outside world will not change that.        China is not the Soviet Union. The US cannot deal with China as it did with the Soviet Union.        That last line became a Chinese political mantra with blinding speed after Pence’s speech to the Hudson Institute was compared to Churchill’s Iron Curtain speech.        On Monday  the Global Times pronounced China hurt and confused by the “stinging” speech Pence delivered to the Hudson Institute  filled with accusations that were “vitriolic  ruthless  and delivered in terms considered far from decorous.”        This second editorial invoked the “Thucydides Trap ” which has become another common talking point for Chinese politicians. The Thucydides Trap is a theory that posits ruling powers almost always go to war with rising powers  usually to the regret of both nations  unless extraordinary efforts are made to avoid conflict.        Beijing’s interpretation of Thucydides is that America has a unique responsibility to welcome China as a new global superpower and refrain from protecting American dominance by attempting to “contain” China.        As far as the Chinese are concerned  they are already doing everything a rising power could possibly do to ameliorate the concerns of the aging world hegemon  and they cannot understand why the Trump administration suddenly decided to make a “U-turn” at the urging of “hardliners” and commence efforts to contain China.        The Global Times defended the ad China took out in the Des Moines Register in September  widely seen as a major reason for the Trump administration’s complaint about Chinese interference in U.S. elections.        “Where is the U.S.’ long-hailed freedom of the press?” a state-run newspaper from one of the world’s most aggressive authoritarian regimes risibly asked. In a similar vein  the Global Times portrayed China as merely seeking to defend itself from a “U.S.-initiated trade war ” as if China has not been manipulating markets and stealing technology for decades.        The Global Times concluded President Trump is beating up on China to goose Republican turnout for the midterm elections and distract from “the Russiagate scandal”:        The reason that the Trump administration deliberately chose this timing – when China-US trade tensions are ratcheting up – to deliver the inflammatory speech is the upcoming US midterm elections.        Trump knows that playing the China card is always the safest option. It cannot only divert domestic attention from the Russiagate scandal and shift the political pressure from the president but also incite ordinary voters.        These unfounded accusations show that the understanding and judgment of the Trump administration on Sino-US relations are unprofessional  shallow and indiscreet  which is most worrying. The worsening atmosphere toward China in the US not only affects American public’ opinion on the country but also endangers the safety and interests of Chinese in the US.        When the leader of a state accuses other countries at will  how can he justify his reputation to improve bilateral ties? Perhaps the Trump government needs to think about how to show respect to China before requesting China to respect the US.        The Chinese appear to know the American left is very receptive to theories that President Trump relies on populist appeals to xenophobia and is desperate to distract from the investigation into “Russian collusion” in the 2016 election.“Utterly messed up my life”: What Chinese people really think of the trade war        The Guardian By Echo HuangOctober 9  2018        China’s ardent determination to win the trade war might not have all the public support it would like.        Since the US and China entered a trade war in earnest this year  both sides have been going tit-for-tat with increasing tariffs on goods. The US has put new tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports  while China has done the same to $110 billion worth of US goods. And while China’s running out of US goods to keep the retaliation going  its strongest weapon in this “war of national fate” with the US is the spirit of the Chinese people  according to state media.       \"“The heroism of ‘being the first to show concern and the last to enjoy oneself’ has always run through Chinese blood  which also includes the spirit of ‘sacrificing one’s interest for the greater good of the public  ” said an opinion piece (link in Chinese) posted by the state-run People’s Daily on July 10. “Facing this ‘war of national fate ’ Chinese are deeply aware that ‘there’s no home without a country ’ so they are willing to bear temporary losses.”\"       That comment doesn’t acknowledge how painful the trade war could become for common people. Economists estimate that if the latest Chinese goods to be added to the trade war see tariffs go up to 25% next year  it could shave half a percentage point off China’s growth. Online  people are sharing how they’re experiencing the impacts so far  and worrying about what’s to come.        Stocks tumble  yuan devalues    On Monday (Oct.7)  the first day after the Golden Week holiday  Chinese stocks fell sharply. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.7%—its biggest single-day loss (paywall)  in more than three months. The stock tumble came a day after China’s central bank announced that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks for the fourth time this year—a move seen as trying to boost the economy by increasing liquidity amid the trade war. In general  China’s stock markets haven’t been (paywall) taking the trade war in stride.        “This has been a tough year for me. I haven’t received payments on several projects because of stock bursts ” wrote a user (link in Chinese) of social media platform Weibo  who identified himself as working at a securities firm in Beijing. “The stock market’s tumble and the trade war have killed many projects. When I returned home  the village officials asked me how’s my work so far this year. My answer  sadly  was this—deleveraging  bad stock performance  and the trade war have utterly messed up my life.”        REUTERS/MARIANA BAZO    Looking for new markets.    The devalued yuan has also worried many. While it could help exporters by making their goods more competitive  it makes life tougher for people who need foreign currency  for example families of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese studying abroad.        “We are now kneeling to the trade war. It’s hard to see that the RMB [renminbi] can be stable in the near term. Looks like the Great Depression is going to arrive ” said a Weibo comment (link in Chinese).        Snacks  oil prices up    Treats are suddenly more expensive due to tariffs  and so are daily necessities.        “I ran out of nuts yesterday and wanted to top up my stock ” wrote a female user (link in Chinese) based in northern Hebei province  but she found the nuts she’s used to eating every day  including pecans  commonly sourced from the US  cost her more.        “I asked the shop owner  ‘Why is it more expensive than last time?’ The owner said it’s because of the trade war ” she continued  “And I asked him  ‘What’s the relationship?’ He said that he had imported lots of the nuts from overseas. This is the first time I feel the impact of the trade war.”        As for Maine lobster  forget about it.        Chinese drivers are also feeling the pinch  with China putting tariffs on US oil imports in August.        “I’ve deeply felt that the economic environment is not good. This year  there’s peer-to-peer lending and illegal money-raising crackdown  which also bled out a bunch of people. Now the drop has come to the real estate market…. then there’s the trade war  and oil prices keep going up. It won’t be long before I can’t afford to run my car ” wrote a user (link in Chinese).        Small businesses may be harder hit than larger ones. The most recent Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index  a better gauge of sentiment at smaller  private firms than the official manufacturing PMI  declined from 50.6 in August to 50 last month  the lowest level in more than a year. A number below 50 indicates a contraction.        REUTERS    In response to US tariffs  China has put tariffs on American soybean imports.    Pessimism about the new NAFTA    People aren’t optimistic the pressure on China’s economy will ease up. In fact  the new North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiated by the US  Mexico  and Canada—now with a brand-new acronym—shows the formation of a front against China  some online commenters noted.        “Why is the Chinese economy going to be difficult in the next six months?” wrote a male user (link in Chinese) of micro-blogging site Weibo  based in China’s southwestern Sichuan province. His argument that the elements that have been key to driving China’s economic growth in recent years—including infrastructure  foreign trade  and domestic demands—have all shown worrying signs.         “In terms of foreign trade  this is the most worrying ” he wrote. “The Americans are launching trade wars worldwide because they want to bypass the WTO [World Trade Organization] and build something new. At the end of September  the US  Canada and Mexico signed a new cooperation agreement. The agreement said if a ‘non-market-oriented economy‘ wants to enter their market  it needs the approval of all the three countries… Everyone knows who this ‘non-market-oriented economy’ is.”        (The new NAFTA asks countries in the agreement to notify each other if they are to have trade deal talks with a “non-market” economy  and also give one another a say in the deal.)        “Americans have been building an anti-China circle. In the first round  the Mexico gave in  then Canada. I am afraid that the third round is Japan  then Europe ” said another (link in Chinese). “I highly suggest that China should make major adjustments to its current policies instead of listening to the opinions from so-called elites.”China won’t back down in trade war with US: commerce minister        SCMP Amanda Lee        China will not cave in to US demands even if it faces further tariffs on its exports  China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan has said  signalling Beijing’s uncompromising stance in dealing with US.        “There is a view in the US that so long as the US keeps increasing tariffs  China will back down. They don’t know the history and culture of China ” Zhong said  in a statement published by Bloomberg News.        “This unyielding nation suffered foreign bullying for many times in history  but never succumbed to it even in the most difficult conditions. China doesn’t want a trade war  but would rise up to it should it break out.        “The US should not underestimate China’s resolve and will.”            This is Beijing’s strongest response yet to the trade war following a release of a white paper last month detailing its stance on the trade war  in which China blamed the US for creating the tensions and painted itself as a promoter of free trade.        The strong comments from Zhong  whose ministry is in the front line of any possible talks with the US  coincide with a rapid deterioration in the ties between Beijing and Washington.        Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage ofCHINA’S COMMERCE MINISTER ZHONG SHAN    US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  on a brief visit to Beijing on Monday  had a testy exchange with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.        Wang told Pompeo the US had hurt “mutual trust” and must stop “misguided actions” against China  while Pompeo said there were “fundamental disagreements” between the two powers.        Prospects for Beijing and Washington to de-escalate their trade tensions are not bright.        The two sides have locked horns in levying punitive tariffs against each other and there are gaping differences over a slew of issues from intellectual property rights to the role of state-owned enterprises.            The US initially imposed a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion worth of Chinese imports  and in September added a 10 per cent tariff on an additional US$200 billion of Chinese products  with the tariff rate set to rise to 25 per cent on January 1 if China does not make trade concessions.        China’s central bank to pump US$110 billion into economy as US trade war intensifies    US President Donald Trump has also threatened to extend punitive tariffs to all Chinese imports.        China retaliated with a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion of US imports and variable tariffs of 5 per cent to 10 per cent on a further US$60 billion of US imports.        China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi (left) and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a testy exchange on Monday in Beijing. Photo: AP    Washington is demanding China change its trade practices of forcing US businesses to transfer technologies and of subsidising state-owned enterprises.        Zhong reiterated Beijing’s line that China does not steal technology from US firms.        “I want to emphasise that China’s laws and regulations do not contain any requirement for technology transfer and that companies’ purchases of technologies and patents are pure market behaviour ” he said.        “China’s economic development  and science and technological progress are owed to reform and opening up and the endeavours of the Chinese people.”        As US turns up heat on China  trade war moves beyond tariffs to new battlefronts    Zhong also argued that China never “took advantage of the US” even as the country ran a record trade surplus of US$31.05 billion with the US in August.        “If one side had been taken advantage of all the time  could such business relations have continued? Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage of ” Zhong said.        The conflict between the two countries has now gone beyond trade  with Trump’s accusations that China is attempting to interfere in the 2018 US midterm congressional elections. Vice-President Mike Pence also stepped up the attack by condemning Beijing for using “every tool at its disposal” to undermine the US political system.        Pence also warned American companies  including tech giant Alphabet  which owns Google  to disengage from China.Trump rips up the trade playbook to take on China        Donna Borak  CNN        Updated 1037 GMT (1837 HKT) October 9  2018        Bali  Indonesia (CNN)President Donald Trump wants a deal with China — just not anytime soon.        After announcing a revamped trade agreement with Canada and Mexico last week  Trump reeled off a list of other countries that he said had given in to US demands to hold talks or make a deal: South Korea  Japan  the European Union.    He scoffed at those \"babies out there\" who worried about the effects of tariffs  suggesting that \"we wouldn\\\\ t be talking about a deal\" with Canada and Mexico without his confrontational approach.    The trade war will hit US and Chinese growth next year  the IMF warns    \"That\\\\ s going to embolden him to impose more tariffs and threaten more in the hopes of getting a better deal out of China \" said Edward Alden  a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.   \"Trump s no-holds-barred strategy on China is likely take center stage this week at a summit of global finance chiefs and central bankers in Bali  Indonesia. And it ll be up to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  the president s top economic envoy  to argue the US case as warnings intensify about the damage a protracted trade war could do to global economic growth.\"   \"The stakes are high \" Christine Lagarde  the managing director of the International Monetary Fund  said last week. \"We need to work together to de-escalate and resolve the current trade disputes.\"   \" Coalition of the willing \"  \"If the Trump administration can get the European Union and Japan on side following the recent trade deals with South Korea  Canada and Mexico  that s likely to strengthen the US negotiating position with Beijing  top administration officials argue.\"   US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA        US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA 01:58    \"We are talking to the European Union again  we are talking to Japan again  and we are moving to what I have characterized as a trade coalition of the willing to confront China \" Larry Kudlow  Trump\\\\ s chief economic adviser  said last week.   \"But talks with Europe and Japan are still in the early stages. And French President Emmanuel Macron said last month that Europe shouldn t sign trade deals with any country that doesn t comply with the Paris Agreement on climate change  a clear reference to the United States.\"  \"The Trump administration s approach to building a coalition against Beijing is a break from the old playbook of working collaboratively with allies to address mutual concerns.\"   Other big economies like the European Union and Japan share some of the main US grievances with China  including intellectual property theft and pressure on foreign companies to hand over technology to Chinese partners. But Trump slapped tariffs on key allies at the same time as stepping up his campaign against China  which some analysts suggest has weakened any potential united front.    The Trump administration has imposed new tariffs on about half of China&#39;s annual goods exports to the United States.    Souring relationship   \"Trump has made clear he s in no rush to restart talks with Beijing anytime soon. Instead  he has threatened to impose an even bigger wave of tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese products. That would mean the US measures effectively cover all the goods China sells to the United States each year.\"   \"I\\\\ m using them to negotiate \" Trump said of the tariffs. \"And hopefully  we can make a great deal with China — a fair deal and a reciprocal deal.\"    Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Details of the revised pact with Canada and Mexico  which is set to replace NAFTA  show that the US government is also trying other ways to amplify the pressure on China.    Tucked in the new agreement is a requirement that each country inform the others if it wants to start free trade negotiations with a \"non-market economy \" a clear reference to China. The other countries would also be able to review any potential free trade deal with China.    That move has upset Beijing  further souring the relationship between the two economic superpowers.    In a frank exchange of views in Beijing on Monday  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the United States should immediately stop its \"wrong remarks and actions \" including the trade war. Pompeo responded that the two countries have a \"fundamental disagreement\" and that the United States has \"great concerns about actions that China has taken.\"   \" How much pain are they willing to endure? \"   Neither side is showing signs of backing down.   \"The United States  whose economy relies less on exports than China s  is faring better so far. China s economy had already started slowing down this year and its stock markets and currency have slumped as the trade conflict has escalated.\"   China is pumping more cash into its economy as the trade war heats up    \"The question is: How much pain are they willing to endure?\" said Thomas Bernes  a distinguished fellow for the Centre for International Governance Innovation. \"They will be looking to the midterm elections to see if there is going to be a rejection of Trumpism or whether they he gains strength and remains in power.\"    For its part  the Trump administration appears willing to maintain the pressure for as long as it can.    \"We have changed the paradigm \" US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said last month. \"We have tariffs in place  and the president is not going to let this go along when you have forced transfer of intellectual property.\"    Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires at the end of November.    But with Beijing unwilling to give ground on US demands that it change fundamental parts of its economic policy  the prospects of reaching a deal anytime soon appear slim.    \"It is still hard to see how a further escalation of the trade conflict with China will be avoided \" Andrew Hunter  US economist at research firm Capital Economics said in a note to clients last week.Is China or Russia America’s Defining Rival?    The debate doesn’t just have consequences for U.S. foreign policy—it will define the next decades of domestic affairs as well.        OCT 9  2018        Late last week  as most of America’s political class was transfixed by the denouement of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle  Vice President Mike Pence gave a wide-ranging address on the U.S. relationship with China  and why the Trump administration is committed to opposing its expansionist designs. For the most part  it was a familiar litany of complaints about China’s efforts to coerce its neighbors in the western Pacific  its trade abuses  its hostility to religious freedom  and its support of unsavory regimes around the world. Yet halfway through his remarks  the vice president shifted his emphasis  turning from all the various ways the Chinese party-state was acting in the world outside America’s borders to how it was seeking to influence political and cultural life inside them.        Specifically  Pence warned that “China wants a different American president ” and that Beijing was mobilizing “covert actors  front groups  and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policies” to that end. By now  it has become routine for the heads of U.S. multinationals to condemn the Trump administration’s trade policies  and the fact that they’d do so is perfectly understandable. China’s violent labor repression and its policy of subsidizing industrialists at the expense of households have proved highly advantageous to those seeking a disciplined and relatively low-cost workforce  regardless of their citizenship. According to Pence  however  there is another layer to the politics of trade  namely that senior Chinese officials are threatening to punish business leaders who fail to denounce U.S. tariffs. He pointed to the rising sophistication with which Beijing exploits America’s domestic political cleavages  as evidenced by its targeting of retaliatory tariffs to regions and industries believed crucial to the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections  and its shrewd efforts to silence criticism of Chinese policies on university campuses desperate for Chinese money.

Some observers have dismissed the idea  warning that it represents a distraction from ongoing Russian meddling. Others acknowledge that while China’s efforts to influence democratic outcomes are different in character from Russia’s approach  which Beijing seems to see as “ineffective and counterproductive ” there is no question that  as Rush Doshi and Robert D. Williams of the Brookings Institution have cautiously observed  “China has long pursued a wide-ranging and very real campaign to influence the political and informational environment of other countries  including the United States.”        Needless to say  one could see both Russia and China as dangerous rivals  and I certainly do. But in an age of intensifying partisan enmity  when large numbers of Americans question the legitimacy of the Trump presidency while similarly large numbers see Donald Trump as their champion  it is fitting that Democrats and Republicans can’t bring themselves to agree on which of the world’s revanchist powers ought to serve as what you might call our orienting enemy or  as the Harvard political scientist Samuel P. Huntington once put it  the “other” that gives our grand strategy its ideological shape.        In 1997  not long after the collapse of the Soviet bloc  Huntington warned that American grand strategy was losing its coherence in part because America’s creedal identity had long been defined in opposition to just such an “other.” In the early days of the republic  he observed  it was Britain that offered this necessary contrast: While the British lived under tyranny and hierarchy  Americans told themselves  we enjoyed freedom and equality. So  too  in later years did Wilhelmine Germany provide an orienting rivalry  and then the Nazi and Soviet totalitarianisms that ravaged the world for much of the 20th century. The Soviet Union’s demise therefore prompted a kind of identity crisis. “While wars at times may have a divisive effect on society ” wrote Huntington  “a common enemy can often help to promote identity and cohesion among people. The weakening or absence of a common enemy can do just the reverse.”        What Huntington did not quite anticipate is that America would find itself divided between two creedal identities—one right  one left—each of which defines itself against a different enemy. This is a pattern that has obtained in earlier eras. Consider that the founding generation was bitterly divided over whether Revolutionary France or the British Empire represented the greater threat to American liberty. The early 1900s saw debates between Germanophiles  many of whom were progressives and socialists of German extraction  and Anglophiles who embraced the idea of a world order jointly administered by a British-American condominium. The difference now is that even in the supposed twilight of American global leadership  our creedal clashes reverberate around the world.        And so the United States finds itself in the midst of not one but two cold wars. To cosmopolitan liberals  it is Russia that serves as America’s chief geopolitical adversary. Even in Russia’s weakened and impoverished state  they fear the deftness with which its operatives act in connivance with illiberal elements in the world’s diverse market democracies to undermine them from within. Nationalist conservatives see rising Chinese power as the far graver threat to American interests  and they are increasingly open to wielding the power of the state to resist and counter Beijing’s depredations  despite the cost to economic freedom that may well result.        It is not difficult to understand why Russia has such a hold on the liberal imagination. There is at this point little doubt that the Russian state has sought to sow chaos and division in the U.S. and democratic Europe  in part out of a conviction that Western liberals have done much the same throughout post-Soviet Eurasia. Though the extent to which Russian information operations influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election is contested  the notion that it played a decisive role is an article of faith among Trump’s liberal critics  for whom Vladimir Putin is the perfect foil.        The Putin ascendancy has been defined by  in the first place  rank kleptocracy  but also by an explicit and often deranged antiliberalism  in which the chief enemies of the Russian nation are the forces of gay rights and feminism. As the American author Timothy Snyder has argued  Putinism’s crusade against gay rights was designed “to transform demands for democracy into a nebulous threat to Russian innocence: voting = west = sodomy.” While defining liberalism as the politics of sexual perversion  Putin defines his own regime as the defender of masculinity and traditionalism  and as the natural ally of all those who defend state sovereignty against the supposed cosmopolitan conspiracy to dissolve the natural family. In short  Putin invites cosmopolitan liberals to see Russia under his rule as their enemy  just as he invites right-wing populists in the Western democracies to see him as a friend.        An America that defines itself against Putin’s Russia is an America that would redouble its commitment to cosmopolitan liberalism  including a commitment to free and open trade on a multilateral  nondiscriminatory basis  while marginalizing nationalist conservatism as retrograde. nato would be shored up  which is all to the good  but the U.S. would adopt a warier attitude toward populist parties in Central and Eastern Europe  a stance that could see these democracies drift further out of the American orbit.        And as for the Chinese party-state  it wouldn’t exactly be a friend  especially in light of its hostility to civil liberties  but the Chinese Communist Party’s stated commitment to combating climate change and antitrade nationalist politicians would lend it a certain prestige and legitimacy. Shortly after Trump’s inauguration  Xi Jinping presented himself as a defender of a rules-based international order  the Paris agreement  and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran  and in doing so he won himself admirers in elite circles  especially among those unaware of the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims for political crimes. Over time  a U.S. grand strategy rooted in cosmopolitan liberalism might grow warier of Chinese power  especially if the Chinese party-state were to become more explicitly nationalist as it sees less of a need to cater to cosmopolitan-liberal sensibilities  as seems likely. But by then the economic integration of the Western democracies with China might be irreversible  and Beijing would have the upper hand.        What would it mean for the U.S. to instead choose China as its “other ” as nationalist conservatives would have it? One early indication comes from a recent report from the Department of Defense  which details America’s growing dependence on China’s manufacturing base  and the threat this poses to the country’s war-fighting capabilities. In the 1990s and 2000s  market conservatives could point to the Soviet collapse as an indictment of statism  and to global economic integration as an unambiguous good. Many of these market conservatives now find themselves making common cause with cosmopolitan liberals while nationalist conservatives rethink their commitment to laissez-faire  with an eye toward meeting the challenge posed by a Chinese party-state that sees industrial progress as central to its strategic ambitions. If Beijing  not Moscow  is public enemy No. 1  it is vital that the U.S. boost public investment in infrastructure and human capital  and that it steer U.S. firms to build resilient supply chains based in the Americas  not in China’s industrial heartland. Russia would still be a rival  I suspect  but it would be seen through a different lens: as a potential ally in the protracted conflict with China  as would become much clearer once Putin himself exits the scene.        Culturally  choosing China as an orienting enemy would have more ambiguous effects. One can imagine a xenophobic turn against Chinese immigrants  visitors  and students  which would have ugly consequences. Yet one can also imagine an embrace of the Chinese people on the grounds that Beijing’s authoritarianism serves a narrow elite more than it serves ordinary workers. The argument  in essence  would be that the U.S. stands against the party-state  not China as a whole  and that America would welcome a more just and inclusive Chinese government. Indeed  Pence made exactly this argument in his recent address. More broadly  an America waging a cold war on China might place a somewhat greater emphasis on cohesion and solidarity over cosmopolitanism  not least because disentangling the American and Chinese economies would entail considerable sacrifice on the part of the U.S. business elite—a sacrifice that would have to be justified in solidaristic terms.        Which enemy will we choose in the years to come? Which cold war will we wage most assiduously? The answer will depend in no small part on the outcome of the elections to come. If history is any guide  the stakes are high  and the consequences will be enduring.Chinese Media Vow to Fight Against ‘Insult’ from Pence  Threaten ‘Cold War’        8 Oct 2018        China’s state-run Global Times vowed over the weekend to fight back against “insults” from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and promised a “new Cold War” if the Trump administration forces the issue by continuing to produce “hostile reports and speeches.”    The Global Times took a passive-aggressive approach in an editorial on Sunday  beginning with strong criticism of Pence’s speech at the Hudson Institute last Thursday and citing observers who compared it to Sir Winston Churchill’s “Iron Curtain” speech about the Soviet Union at the dawn of the Cold War.        The editorial soon mellowed into a reflection on high points of the relationship between America and China  such as U.S. President Richard Nixon’s opening to China  and even took some credit for helping President Ronald Reagan put the Soviet Union out of business.        The Global Times then reiterated Beijing’s standard line about how soft  democratic America stands no chance against authoritarian China in a trade war and positioned Beijing as the more mature player in a conflict Washington has not yet realized it cannot win:        The US  in fact  has limited leverage to contain China. A trade war will inevitably damage the US and is a stupid choice. It’s unrealistic to establish a NATO-style organization to target China. It is impossible to isolate and contain China given its expanding business overseas and domestic markets.        It’s difficult for the White House and Congress to mobilize an anti-China campaign in US society. Gone are the days when the public was willing to take a plunge for the so-called national interest. As long as China keeps calm in the face of hysterical US political elites  the so-called Cold War will not take shape.        At such a time  China should play tai chi with the US. This is the unique strategic wisdom of the Chinese nation. We must make the US feel the pain of the trade war and not allow the US to act unscrupulously in the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits. But we must act in a calm way. China will continue to open up. A deteriorating outside world will not change that.        China is not the Soviet Union. The US cannot deal with China as it did with the Soviet Union.        That last line became a Chinese political mantra with blinding speed after Pence’s speech to the Hudson Institute was compared to Churchill’s Iron Curtain speech.        On Monday  the Global Times pronounced China hurt and confused by the “stinging” speech Pence delivered to the Hudson Institute  filled with accusations that were “vitriolic  ruthless  and delivered in terms considered far from decorous.”        This second editorial invoked the “Thucydides Trap ” which has become another common talking point for Chinese politicians. The Thucydides Trap is a theory that posits ruling powers almost always go to war with rising powers  usually to the regret of both nations  unless extraordinary efforts are made to avoid conflict.        Beijing’s interpretation of Thucydides is that America has a unique responsibility to welcome China as a new global superpower and refrain from protecting American dominance by attempting to “contain” China.        As far as the Chinese are concerned  they are already doing everything a rising power could possibly do to ameliorate the concerns of the aging world hegemon  and they cannot understand why the Trump administration suddenly decided to make a “U-turn” at the urging of “hardliners” and commence efforts to contain China.        The Global Times defended the ad China took out in the Des Moines Register in September  widely seen as a major reason for the Trump administration’s complaint about Chinese interference in U.S. elections.        “Where is the U.S.’ long-hailed freedom of the press?” a state-run newspaper from one of the world’s most aggressive authoritarian regimes risibly asked. In a similar vein  the Global Times portrayed China as merely seeking to defend itself from a “U.S.-initiated trade war ” as if China has not been manipulating markets and stealing technology for decades.        The Global Times concluded President Trump is beating up on China to goose Republican turnout for the midterm elections and distract from “the Russiagate scandal”:        The reason that the Trump administration deliberately chose this timing – when China-US trade tensions are ratcheting up – to deliver the inflammatory speech is the upcoming US midterm elections.        Trump knows that playing the China card is always the safest option. It cannot only divert domestic attention from the Russiagate scandal and shift the political pressure from the president but also incite ordinary voters.        These unfounded accusations show that the understanding and judgment of the Trump administration on Sino-US relations are unprofessional  shallow and indiscreet  which is most worrying. The worsening atmosphere toward China in the US not only affects American public’ opinion on the country but also endangers the safety and interests of Chinese in the US.        When the leader of a state accuses other countries at will  how can he justify his reputation to improve bilateral ties? Perhaps the Trump government needs to think about how to show respect to China before requesting China to respect the US.        The Chinese appear to know the American left is very receptive to theories that President Trump relies on populist appeals to xenophobia and is desperate to distract from the investigation into “Russian collusion” in the 2016 election. ]'"

       "'[  Utterly messed up my life   What Chinese people really think of the trade war        The Guardian By Echo HuangOctober 9  2018        China’s ardent determination to win the trade war might not have all the public support it would like.        Since the US and China entered a trade war in earnest this year  both sides have been going tit-for-tat with increasing tariffs on goods. The US has put new tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports  while China has done the same to $110 billion worth of US goods. And while China’s running out of US goods to keep the retaliation going  its strongest weapon in this  war of national fate  with the US is the spirit of the Chinese people  according to state media.         The heroism of  being the first to show concern and the last to enjoy oneself’ has always run through Chinese blood  which also includes the spirit of  sacrificing one’s interest for the greater good of the public    said an opinion piece (link in Chinese) posted by the state-run People’s Daily on July 10.  Facing this  war of national fate ’ Chinese are deeply aware that  there’s no home without a country ’ so they are willing to bear temporary losses.         That comment doesn’t acknowledge how painful the trade war could become for common people. Economists estimate that if the latest Chinese goods to be added to the trade war see tariffs go up to 25% next year  it could shave half a percentage point off China’s growth. Online  people are sharing how they’re experiencing the impacts so far  and worrying about what’s to come.        Stocks tumble  yuan devalues    On Monday (Oct.7)  the first day after the Golden Week holiday  Chinese stocks fell sharply. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.7%—its biggest single-day loss (paywall)  in more than three months. The stock tumble came a day after China’s central bank announced that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks for the fourth time this year—a move seen as trying to boost the economy by increasing liquidity amid the trade war. In general  China’s stock markets haven’t been (paywall) taking the trade war in stride.         This has been a tough year for me. I haven’t received payments on several projects because of stock bursts   wrote a user (link in Chinese) of social media platform Weibo  who identified himself as working at a securities firm in Beijing.  The stock market’s tumble and the trade war have killed many projects. When I returned home  the village officials asked me how’s my work so far this year. My answer  sadly  was this—deleveraging  bad stock performance  and the trade war have utterly messed up my life.         REUTERS/MARIANA BAZO    Looking for new markets.    The devalued yuan has also worried many. While it could help exporters by making their goods more competitive  it makes life tougher for people who need foreign currency  for example families of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese studying abroad.         We are now kneeling to the trade war. It’s hard to see that the RMB [renminbi] can be stable in the near term. Looks like the Great Depression is going to arrive   said a Weibo comment (link in Chinese).        Snacks  oil prices up    Treats are suddenly more expensive due to tariffs  and so are daily necessities.         I ran out of nuts yesterday and wanted to top up my stock   wrote a female user (link in Chinese) based in northern Hebei province  but she found the nuts she’s used to eating every day  including pecans  commonly sourced from the US  cost her more.         I asked the shop owner   Why is it more expensive than last time?’ The owner said it’s because of the trade war   she continued   And I asked him   What’s the relationship?’ He said that he had imported lots of the nuts from overseas. This is the first time I feel the impact of the trade war.         As for Maine lobster  forget about it.        Chinese drivers are also feeling the pinch  with China putting tariffs on US oil imports in August.         I’ve deeply felt that the economic environment is not good. This year  there’s peer-to-peer lending and illegal money-raising crackdown  which also bled out a bunch of people. Now the drop has come to the real estate market…. then there’s the trade war  and oil prices keep going up. It won’t be long before I can’t afford to run my car   wrote a user (link in Chinese).        Small businesses may be harder hit than larger ones. The most recent Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index  a better gauge of sentiment at smaller  private firms than the official manufacturing PMI  declined from 50.6 in August to 50 last month  the lowest level in more than a year. A number below 50 indicates a contraction.        REUTERS    In response to US tariffs  China has put tariffs on American soybean imports.    Pessimism about the new NAFTA    People aren’t optimistic the pressure on China’s economy will ease up. In fact  the new North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiated by the US  Mexico  and Canada—now with a brand-new acronym—shows the formation of a front against China  some online commenters noted.         Why is the Chinese economy going to be difficult in the next six months?  wrote a male user (link in Chinese) of micro-blogging site Weibo  based in China’s southwestern Sichuan province. His argument that the elements that have been key to driving China’s economic growth in recent years—including infrastructure  foreign trade  and domestic demands—have all shown worrying signs.          In terms of foreign trade  this is the most worrying   he wrote.  The Americans are launching trade wars worldwide because they want to bypass the WTO [World Trade Organization] and build something new. At the end of September  the US  Canada and Mexico signed a new cooperation agreement. The agreement said if a  non-market-oriented economy  wants to enter their market  it needs the approval of all the three countries… Everyone knows who this  non-market-oriented economy’ is.         (The new NAFTA asks countries in the agreement to notify each other if they are to have trade deal talks with a  non-market  economy  and also give one another a say in the deal.)         Americans have been building an anti-China circle. In the first round  the Mexico gave in  then Canada. I am afraid that the third round is Japan  then Europe   said another (link in Chinese).  I highly suggest that China should make major adjustments to its current policies instead of listening to the opinions from so-called elites. China won’t back down in trade war with US  commerce minister        SCMP Amanda Lee        China will not cave in to US demands even if it faces further tariffs on its exports  China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan has said  signalling Beijing’s uncompromising stance in dealing with US.         There is a view in the US that so long as the US keeps increasing tariffs  China will back down. They don’t know the history and culture of China   Zhong said  in a statement published by Bloomberg News.         This unyielding nation suffered foreign bullying for many times in history  but never succumbed to it even in the most difficult conditions. China doesn’t want a trade war  but would rise up to it should it break out.         The US should not underestimate China’s resolve and will.             This is Beijing’s strongest response yet to the trade war following a release of a white paper last month detailing its stance on the trade war  in which China blamed the US for creating the tensions and painted itself as a promoter of free trade.        The strong comments from Zhong  whose ministry is in the front line of any possible talks with the US  coincide with a rapid deterioration in the ties between Beijing and Washington.        Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage ofCHINA’S COMMERCE MINISTER ZHONG SHAN    US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  on a brief visit to Beijing on Monday  had a testy exchange with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.        Wang told Pompeo the US had hurt  mutual trust  and must stop  misguided actions  against China  while Pompeo said there were  fundamental disagreements  between the two powers.        Prospects for Beijing and Washington to de-escalate their trade tensions are not bright.        The two sides have locked horns in levying punitive tariffs against each other and there are gaping differences over a slew of issues from intellectual property rights to the role of state-owned enterprises.            The US initially imposed a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion worth of Chinese imports  and in September added a 10 per cent tariff on an additional US$200 billion of Chinese products  with the tariff rate set to rise to 25 per cent on January 1 if China does not make trade concessions.        China’s central bank to pump US$110 billion into economy as US trade war intensifies    US President Donald Trump has also threatened to extend punitive tariffs to all Chinese imports.        China retaliated with a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion of US imports and variable tariffs of 5 per cent to 10 per cent on a further US$60 billion of US imports.        China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi (left) and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a testy exchange on Monday in Beijing. Photo  AP    Washington is demanding China change its trade practices of forcing US businesses to transfer technologies and of subsidising state-owned enterprises.        Zhong reiterated Beijing’s line that China does not steal technology from US firms.         I want to emphasise that China’s laws and regulations do not contain any requirement for technology transfer and that companies’ purchases of technologies and patents are pure market behaviour   he said.         China’s economic development  and science and technological progress are owed to reform and opening up and the endeavours of the Chinese people.         As US turns up heat on China  trade war moves beyond tariffs to new battlefronts    Zhong also argued that China never  took advantage of the US  even as the country ran a record trade surplus of US$31.05 billion with the US in August.         If one side had been taken advantage of all the time  could such business relations have continued? Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage of   Zhong said.        The conflict between the two countries has now gone beyond trade  with Trump’s accusations that China is attempting to interfere in the 2018 US midterm congressional elections. Vice-President Mike Pence also stepped up the attack by condemning Beijing for using  every tool at its disposal  to undermine the US political system.        Pence also warned American companies  including tech giant Alphabet  which owns Google  to disengage from China.Trump rips up the trade playbook to take on China        Donna Borak  CNN        Updated 1037 GMT (1837 HKT) October 9  2018        Bali  Indonesia (CNN)President Donald Trump wants a deal with China — just not anytime soon.        After announcing a revamped trade agreement with Canada and Mexico last week  Trump reeled off a list of other countries that he said had given in to US demands to hold talks or make a deal  South Korea  Japan  the European Union.    He scoffed at those  babies out there  who worried about the effects of tariffs  suggesting that  we wouldn  t be talking about a deal  with Canada and Mexico without his confrontational approach.    The trade war will hit US and Chinese growth next year  the IMF warns     That  s going to embolden him to impose more tariffs and threaten more in the hopes of getting a better deal out of China   said Edward Alden  a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.    Trump s no-holds-barred strategy on China is likely take center stage this week at a summit of global finance chiefs and central bankers in Bali  Indonesia. And it ll be up to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  the president s top economic envoy  to argue the US case as warnings intensify about the damage a protracted trade war could do to global economic growth.     The stakes are high   Christine Lagarde  the managing director of the International Monetary Fund  said last week.  We need to work together to de-escalate and resolve the current trade disputes.      Coalition of the willing     If the Trump administration can get the European Union and Japan on side following the recent trade deals with South Korea  Canada and Mexico  that s likely to strengthen the US negotiating position with Beijing  top administration officials argue.    US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA        US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA 01 58     We are talking to the European Union again  we are talking to Japan again  and we are moving to what I have characterized as a trade coalition of the willing to confront China   Larry Kudlow  Trump  s chief economic adviser  said last week.    But talks with Europe and Japan are still in the early stages. And French President Emmanuel Macron said last month that Europe shouldn t sign trade deals with any country that doesn t comply with the Paris Agreement on climate change  a clear reference to the United States.    The Trump administration s approach to building a coalition against Beijing is a break from the old playbook of working collaboratively with allies to address mutual concerns.    Other big economies like the European Union and Japan share some of the main US grievances with China  including intellectual property theft and pressure on foreign companies to hand over technology to Chinese partners. But Trump slapped tariffs on key allies at the same time as stepping up his campaign against China  which some analysts suggest has weakened any potential united front.    The Trump administration has imposed new tariffs on about half of China&#39;s annual goods exports to the United States.    Souring relationship    Trump has made clear he s in no rush to restart talks with Beijing anytime soon. Instead  he has threatened to impose an even bigger wave of tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese products. That would mean the US measures effectively cover all the goods China sells to the United States each year.     I  m using them to negotiate   Trump said of the tariffs.  And hopefully  we can make a great deal with China — a fair deal and a reciprocal deal.     Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Details of the revised pact with Canada and Mexico  which is set to replace NAFTA  show that the US government is also trying other ways to amplify the pressure on China.    Tucked in the new agreement is a requirement that each country inform the others if it wants to start free trade negotiations with a  non-market economy   a clear reference to China. The other countries would also be able to review any potential free trade deal with China.    That move has upset Beijing  further souring the relationship between the two economic superpowers.    In a frank exchange of views in Beijing on Monday  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the United States should immediately stop its  wrong remarks and actions   including the trade war. Pompeo responded that the two countries have a  fundamental disagreement  and that the United States has  great concerns about actions that China has taken.      How much pain are they willing to endure?     Neither side is showing signs of backing down.    The United States  whose economy relies less on exports than China s  is faring better so far. China s economy had already started slowing down this year and its stock markets and currency have slumped as the trade conflict has escalated.    China is pumping more cash into its economy as the trade war heats up     The question is  How much pain are they willing to endure?  said Thomas Bernes  a distinguished fellow for the Centre for International Governance Innovation.  They will be looking to the midterm elections to see if there is going to be a rejection of Trumpism or whether they he gains strength and remains in power.     For its part  the Trump administration appears willing to maintain the pressure for as long as it can.     We have changed the paradigm   US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said last month.  We have tariffs in place  and the president is not going to let this go along when you have forced transfer of intellectual property.     Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires at the end of November.    But with Beijing unwilling to give ground on US demands that it change fundamental parts of its economic policy  the prospects of reaching a deal anytime soon appear slim.     It is still hard to see how a further escalation of the trade conflict with China will be avoided   Andrew Hunter  US economist at research firm Capital Economics said in a note to clients last week.Is China or Russia America’s Defining Rival?    The debate doesn’t just have consequences for U.S. foreign policy—it will define the next decades of domestic affairs as well.        OCT 9  2018        Late last week  as most of America’s political class was transfixed by the denouement of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle  Vice President Mike Pence gave a wide-ranging address on the U.S. relationship with China  and why the Trump administration is committed to opposing its expansionist designs. For the most part  it was a familiar litany of complaints about China’s efforts to coerce its neighbors in the western Pacific  its trade abuses  its hostility to religious freedom  and its support of unsavory regimes around the world. Yet halfway through his remarks  the vice president shifted his emphasis  turning from all the various ways the Chinese party-state was acting in the world outside America’s borders to how it was seeking to influence political and cultural life inside them.        Specifically  Pence warned that  China wants a different American president   and that Beijing was mobilizing  covert actors  front groups  and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policies  to that end. By now  it has become routine for the heads of U.S. multinationals to condemn the Trump administration’s trade policies  and the fact that they’d do so is perfectly understandable. China’s violent labor repression and its policy of subsidizing industrialists at the expense of households have proved highly advantageous to those seeking a disciplined and relatively low-cost workforce  regardless of their citizenship. According to Pence  however  there is another layer to the politics of trade  namely that senior Chinese officials are threatening to punish business leaders who fail to denounce U.S. tariffs. He pointed to the rising sophistication with which Beijing exploits America’s domestic political cleavages  as evidenced by its targeting of retaliatory tariffs to regions and industries believed crucial to the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections  and its shrewd efforts to silence criticism of Chinese policies on university campuses desperate for Chinese money.

The implicit question raised by both Pence and Trump is this  Should we be more worried about Chinese meddling than Russian meddling? Some observers have dismissed the idea  warning that it represents a distraction from ongoing Russian meddling. Others acknowledge that while China’s efforts to influence democratic outcomes are different in character from Russia’s approach  which Beijing seems to see as  ineffective and counterproductive   there is no question that  as Rush Doshi and Robert D. Williams of the Brookings Institution have cautiously observed   China has long pursued a wide-ranging and very real campaign to influence the political and informational environment of other countries  including the United States.         Needless to say  one could see both Russia and China as dangerous rivals  and I certainly do. But in an age of intensifying partisan enmity  when large numbers of Americans question the legitimacy of the Trump presidency while similarly large numbers see Donald Trump as their champion  it is fitting that Democrats and Republicans can’t bring themselves to agree on which of the world’s revanchist powers ought to serve as what you might call our orienting enemy or  as the Harvard political scientist Samuel P. Huntington once put it  the  other  that gives our grand strategy its ideological shape.        In 1997  not long after the collapse of the Soviet bloc  Huntington warned that American grand strategy was losing its coherence in part because America’s creedal identity had long been defined in opposition to just such an  other.  In the early days of the republic  he observed  it was Britain that offered this necessary contrast  While the British lived under tyranny and hierarchy  Americans told themselves  we enjoyed freedom and equality. So  too  in later years did Wilhelmine Germany provide an orienting rivalry  and then the Nazi and Soviet totalitarianisms that ravaged the world for much of the 20th century. The Soviet Union’s demise therefore prompted a kind of identity crisis.  While wars at times may have a divisive effect on society   wrote Huntington   a common enemy can often help to promote identity and cohesion among people. The weakening or absence of a common enemy can do just the reverse.         What Huntington did not quite anticipate is that America would find itself divided between two creedal identities—one right  one left—each of which defines itself against a different enemy. This is a pattern that has obtained in earlier eras. Consider that the founding generation was bitterly divided over whether Revolutionary France or the British Empire represented the greater threat to American liberty. The early 1900s saw debates between Germanophiles  many of whom were progressives and socialists of German extraction  and Anglophiles who embraced the idea of a world order jointly administered by a British-American condominium. The difference now is that even in the supposed twilight of American global leadership  our creedal clashes reverberate around the world.        And so the United States finds itself in the midst of not one but two cold wars. To cosmopolitan liberals  it is Russia that serves as America’s chief geopolitical adversary. Even in Russia’s weakened and impoverished state  they fear the deftness with which its operatives act in connivance with illiberal elements in the world’s diverse market democracies to undermine them from within. Nationalist conservatives see rising Chinese power as the far graver threat to American interests  and they are increasingly open to wielding the power of the state to resist and counter Beijing’s depredations  despite the cost to economic freedom that may well result.        It is not difficult to understand why Russia has such a hold on the liberal imagination. There is at this point little doubt that the Russian state has sought to sow chaos and division in the U.S. and democratic Europe  in part out of a conviction that Western liberals have done much the same throughout post-Soviet Eurasia. Though the extent to which Russian information operations influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election is contested  the notion that it played a decisive role is an article of faith among Trump’s liberal critics  for whom Vladimir Putin is the perfect foil.        The Putin ascendancy has been defined by  in the first place  rank kleptocracy  but also by an explicit and often deranged antiliberalism  in which the chief enemies of the Russian nation are the forces of gay rights and feminism. As the American author Timothy Snyder has argued  Putinism’s crusade against gay rights was designed  to transform demands for democracy into a nebulous threat to Russian innocence  voting = west = sodomy.  While defining liberalism as the politics of sexual perversion  Putin defines his own regime as the defender of masculinity and traditionalism  and as the natural ally of all those who defend state sovereignty against the supposed cosmopolitan conspiracy to dissolve the natural family. In short  Putin invites cosmopolitan liberals to see Russia under his rule as their enemy  just as he invites right-wing populists in the Western democracies to see him as a friend.        An America that defines itself against Putin’s Russia is an America that would redouble its commitment to cosmopolitan liberalism  including a commitment to free and open trade on a multilateral  nondiscriminatory basis  while marginalizing nationalist conservatism as retrograde. nato would be shored up  which is all to the good  but the U.S. would adopt a warier attitude toward populist parties in Central and Eastern Europe  a stance that could see these democracies drift further out of the American orbit.        And as for the Chinese party-state  it wouldn’t exactly be a friend  especially in light of its hostility to civil liberties  but the Chinese Communist Party’s stated commitment to combating climate change and antitrade nationalist politicians would lend it a certain prestige and legitimacy. Shortly after Trump’s inauguration  Xi Jinping presented himself as a defender of a rules-based international order  the Paris agreement  and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran  and in doing so he won himself admirers in elite circles  especially among those unaware of the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims for political crimes. Over time  a U.S. grand strategy rooted in cosmopolitan liberalism might grow warier of Chinese power  especially if the Chinese party-state were to become more explicitly nationalist as it sees less of a need to cater to cosmopolitan-liberal sensibilities  as seems likely. But by then the economic integration of the Western democracies with China might be irreversible  and Beijing would have the upper hand.        What would it mean for the U.S. to instead choose China as its  other   as nationalist conservatives would have it? One early indication comes from a recent report from the Department of Defense  which details America’s growing dependence on China’s manufacturing base  and the threat this poses to the country’s war-fighting capabilities. In the 1990s and 2000s  market conservatives could point to the Soviet collapse as an indictment of statism  and to global economic integration as an unambiguous good. Many of these market conservatives now find themselves making common cause with cosmopolitan liberals while nationalist conservatives rethink their commitment to laissez-faire  with an eye toward meeting the challenge posed by a Chinese party-state that sees industrial progress as central to its strategic ambitions. If Beijing  not Moscow  is public enemy No. 1  it is vital that the U.S. boost public investment in infrastructure and human capital  and that it steer U.S. firms to build resilient supply chains based in the Americas  not in China’s industrial heartland. Russia would still be a rival  I suspect  but it would be seen through a different lens  as a potential ally in the protracted conflict with China  as would become much clearer once Putin himself exits the scene.        Culturally  choosing China as an orienting enemy would have more ambiguous effects. One can imagine a xenophobic turn against Chinese immigrants  visitors  and students  which would have ugly consequences. Yet one can also imagine an embrace of the Chinese people on the grounds that Beijing’s authoritarianism serves a narrow elite more than it serves ordinary workers. The argument  in essence  would be that the U.S. stands against the party-state  not China as a whole  and that America would welcome a more just and inclusive Chinese government. Indeed  Pence made exactly this argument in his recent address. More broadly  an America waging a cold war on China might place a somewhat greater emphasis on cohesion and solidarity over cosmopolitanism  not least because disentangling the American and Chinese economies would entail considerable sacrifice on the part of the U.S. business elite—a sacrifice that would have to be justified in solidaristic terms.        Which enemy will we choose in the years to come? Which cold war will we wage most assiduously? The answer will depend in no small part on the outcome of the elections to come. If history is any guide  the stakes are high  and the consequences will be enduring.Chinese Media Vow to Fight Against  Insult’ from Pence  Threaten  Cold War’        8 Oct 2018        China’s state-run Global Times vowed over the weekend to fight back against  insults  from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and promised a  new Cold War  if the Trump administration forces the issue by continuing to produce  hostile reports and speeches.     The Global Times took a passive-aggressive approach in an editorial on Sunday  beginning with strong criticism of Pence’s speech at the Hudson Institute last Thursday and citing observers who compared it to Sir Winston Churchill’s  Iron Curtain  speech about the Soviet Union at the dawn of the Cold War.        The editorial soon mellowed into a reflection on high points of the relationship between America and China  such as U.S. President Richard Nixon’s opening to China  and even took some credit for helping President Ronald Reagan put the Soviet Union out of business.        The Global Times then reiterated Beijing’s standard line about how soft  democratic America stands no chance against authoritarian China in a trade war and positioned Beijing as the more mature player in a conflict Washington has not yet realized it cannot win         The US  in fact  has limited leverage to contain China. A trade war will inevitably damage the US and is a stupid choice. It’s unrealistic to establish a NATO-style organization to target China. It is impossible to isolate and contain China given its expanding business overseas and domestic markets.        It’s difficult for the White House and Congress to mobilize an anti-China campaign in US society. Gone are the days when the public was willing to take a plunge for the so-called national interest. As long as China keeps calm in the face of hysterical US political elites  the so-called Cold War will not take shape.        At such a time  China should play tai chi with the US. This is the unique strategic wisdom of the Chinese nation. We must make the US feel the pain of the trade war and not allow the US to act unscrupulously in the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits. But we must act in a calm way. China will continue to open up. A deteriorating outside world will not change that.        China is not the Soviet Union. The US cannot deal with China as it did with the Soviet Union.        That last line became a Chinese political mantra with blinding speed after Pence’s speech to the Hudson Institute was compared to Churchill’s Iron Curtain speech.        On Monday  the Global Times pronounced China hurt and confused by the  stinging  speech Pence delivered to the Hudson Institute  filled with accusations that were  vitriolic  ruthless  and delivered in terms considered far from decorous.         This second editorial invoked the  Thucydides Trap   which has become another common talking point for Chinese politicians. The Thucydides Trap is a theory that posits ruling powers almost always go to war with rising powers  usually to the regret of both nations  unless extraordinary efforts are made to avoid conflict.        Beijing’s interpretation of Thucydides is that America has a unique responsibility to welcome China as a new global superpower and refrain from protecting American dominance by attempting to  contain  China.        As far as the Chinese are concerned  they are already doing everything a rising power could possibly do to ameliorate the concerns of the aging world hegemon  and they cannot understand why the Trump administration suddenly decided to make a  U-turn  at the urging of  hardliners  and commence efforts to contain China.        The Global Times defended the ad China took out in the Des Moines Register in September  widely seen as a major reason for the Trump administration’s complaint about Chinese interference in U.S. elections.         Where is the U.S.’ long-hailed freedom of the press?  a state-run newspaper from one of the world’s most aggressive authoritarian regimes risibly asked. In a similar vein  the Global Times portrayed China as merely seeking to defend itself from a  U.S.-initiated trade war   as if China has not been manipulating markets and stealing technology for decades.        The Global Times concluded President Trump is beating up on China to goose Republican turnout for the midterm elections and distract from  the Russiagate scandal          The reason that the Trump administration deliberately chose this timing – when China-US trade tensions are ratcheting up – to deliver the inflammatory speech is the upcoming US midterm elections.        Trump knows that playing the China card is always the safest option. It cannot only divert domestic attention from the Russiagate scandal and shift the political pressure from the president but also incite ordinary voters.        These unfounded accusations show that the understanding and judgment of the Trump administration on Sino-US relations are unprofessional  shallow and indiscreet  which is most worrying. The worsening atmosphere toward China in the US not only affects American public’ opinion on the country but also endangers the safety and interests of Chinese in the US.        When the leader of a state accuses other countries at will  how can he justify his reputation to improve bilateral ties? Perhaps the Trump government needs to think about how to show respect to China before requesting China to respect the US.        The Chinese appear to know the American left is very receptive to theories that President Trump relies on populist appeals to xenophobia and is desperate to distract from the investigation into  Russian collusion  in the 2016 election. Utterly messed up my life   What Chinese people really think of the trade war        The Guardian By Echo HuangOctober 9  2018        China’s ardent determination to win the trade war might not have all the public support it would like.        Since the US and China entered a trade war in earnest this year  both sides have been going tit-for-tat with increasing tariffs on goods. The US has put new tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports  while China has done the same to $110 billion worth of US goods. And while China’s running out of US goods to keep the retaliation going  its strongest weapon in this  war of national fate  with the US is the spirit of the Chinese people  according to state media.         The heroism of  being the first to show concern and the last to enjoy oneself’ has always run through Chinese blood  which also includes the spirit of  sacrificing one’s interest for the greater good of the public    said an opinion piece (link in Chinese) posted by the state-run People’s Daily on July 10.  Facing this  war of national fate ’ Chinese are deeply aware that  there’s no home without a country ’ so they are willing to bear temporary losses.         That comment doesn’t acknowledge how painful the trade war could become for common people. Economists estimate that if the latest Chinese goods to be added to the trade war see tariffs go up to 25% next year  it could shave half a percentage point off China’s growth. Online  people are sharing how they’re experiencing the impacts so far  and worrying about what’s to come.        Stocks tumble  yuan devalues    On Monday (Oct.7)  the first day after the Golden Week holiday  Chinese stocks fell sharply. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.7%—its biggest single-day loss (paywall)  in more than three months. The stock tumble came a day after China’s central bank announced that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks for the fourth time this year—a move seen as trying to boost the economy by increasing liquidity amid the trade war. In general  China’s stock markets haven’t been (paywall) taking the trade war in stride.         This has been a tough year for me. I haven’t received payments on several projects because of stock bursts   wrote a user (link in Chinese) of social media platform Weibo  who identified himself as working at a securities firm in Beijing.  The stock market’s tumble and the trade war have killed many projects. When I returned home  the village officials asked me how’s my work so far this year. My answer  sadly  was this—deleveraging  bad stock performance  and the trade war have utterly messed up my life.         REUTERS/MARIANA BAZO    Looking for new markets.    The devalued yuan has also worried many. While it could help exporters by making their goods more competitive  it makes life tougher for people who need foreign currency  for example families of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese studying abroad.         We are now kneeling to the trade war. It’s hard to see that the RMB [renminbi] can be stable in the near term. Looks like the Great Depression is going to arrive   said a Weibo comment (link in Chinese).        Snacks  oil prices up    Treats are suddenly more expensive due to tariffs  and so are daily necessities.         I ran out of nuts yesterday and wanted to top up my stock   wrote a female user (link in Chinese) based in northern Hebei province  but she found the nuts she’s used to eating every day  including pecans  commonly sourced from the US  cost her more.         I asked the shop owner   Why is it more expensive than last time?’ The owner said it’s because of the trade war   she continued   And I asked him   What’s the relationship?’ He said that he had imported lots of the nuts from overseas. This is the first time I feel the impact of the trade war.         As for Maine lobster  forget about it.        Chinese drivers are also feeling the pinch  with China putting tariffs on US oil imports in August.         I’ve deeply felt that the economic environment is not good. This year  there’s peer-to-peer lending and illegal money-raising crackdown  which also bled out a bunch of people. Now the drop has come to the real estate market…. then there’s the trade war  and oil prices keep going up. It won’t be long before I can’t afford to run my car   wrote a user (link in Chinese).        Small businesses may be harder hit than larger ones. The most recent Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index  a better gauge of sentiment at smaller  private firms than the official manufacturing PMI  declined from 50.6 in August to 50 last month  the lowest level in more than a year. A number below 50 indicates a contraction.        REUTERS    In response to US tariffs  China has put tariffs on American soybean imports.    Pessimism about the new NAFTA    People aren’t optimistic the pressure on China’s economy will ease up. In fact  the new North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiated by the US  Mexico  and Canada—now with a brand-new acronym—shows the formation of a front against China  some online commenters noted.         Why is the Chinese economy going to be difficult in the next six months?  wrote a male user (link in Chinese) of micro-blogging site Weibo  based in China’s southwestern Sichuan province. His argument that the elements that have been key to driving China’s economic growth in recent years—including infrastructure  foreign trade  and domestic demands—have all shown worrying signs.          In terms of foreign trade  this is the most worrying   he wrote.  The Americans are launching trade wars worldwide because they want to bypass the WTO [World Trade Organization] and build something new. At the end of September  the US  Canada and Mexico signed a new cooperation agreement. The agreement said if a  non-market-oriented economy  wants to enter their market  it needs the approval of all the three countries… Everyone knows who this  non-market-oriented economy’ is.         (The new NAFTA asks countries in the agreement to notify each other if they are to have trade deal talks with a  non-market  economy  and also give one another a say in the deal.)         Americans have been building an anti-China circle. In the first round  the Mexico gave in  then Canada. I am afraid that the third round is Japan  then Europe   said another (link in Chinese).  I highly suggest that China should make major adjustments to its current policies instead of listening to the opinions from so-called elites. China won’t back down in trade war with US  commerce minister        SCMP Amanda Lee        China will not cave in to US demands even if it faces further tariffs on its exports  China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan has said  signalling Beijing’s uncompromising stance in dealing with US.         There is a view in the US that so long as the US keeps increasing tariffs  China will back down. They don’t know the history and culture of China   Zhong said  in a statement published by Bloomberg News.         This unyielding nation suffered foreign bullying for many times in history  but never succumbed to it even in the most difficult conditions. China doesn’t want a trade war  but would rise up to it should it break out.         The US should not underestimate China’s resolve and will.             This is Beijing’s strongest response yet to the trade war following a release of a white paper last month detailing its stance on the trade war  in which China blamed the US for creating the tensions and painted itself as a promoter of free trade.        The strong comments from Zhong  whose ministry is in the front line of any possible talks with the US  coincide with a rapid deterioration in the ties between Beijing and Washington.        Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage ofCHINA’S COMMERCE MINISTER ZHONG SHAN    US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  on a brief visit to Beijing on Monday  had a testy exchange with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.        Wang told Pompeo the US had hurt  mutual trust  and must stop  misguided actions  against China  while Pompeo said there were  fundamental disagreements  between the two powers.        Prospects for Beijing and Washington to de-escalate their trade tensions are not bright.        The two sides have locked horns in levying punitive tariffs against each other and there are gaping differences over a slew of issues from intellectual property rights to the role of state-owned enterprises.            The US initially imposed a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion worth of Chinese imports  and in September added a 10 per cent tariff on an additional US$200 billion of Chinese products  with the tariff rate set to rise to 25 per cent on January 1 if China does not make trade concessions.        China’s central bank to pump US$110 billion into economy as US trade war intensifies    US President Donald Trump has also threatened to extend punitive tariffs to all Chinese imports.        China retaliated with a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion of US imports and variable tariffs of 5 per cent to 10 per cent on a further US$60 billion of US imports.        China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi (left) and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a testy exchange on Monday in Beijing. Photo  AP    Washington is demanding China change its trade practices of forcing US businesses to transfer technologies and of subsidising state-owned enterprises.        Zhong reiterated Beijing’s line that China does not steal technology from US firms.         I want to emphasise that China’s laws and regulations do not contain any requirement for technology transfer and that companies’ purchases of technologies and patents are pure market behaviour   he said.         China’s economic development  and science and technological progress are owed to reform and opening up and the endeavours of the Chinese people.         As US turns up heat on China  trade war moves beyond tariffs to new battlefronts    Zhong also argued that China never  took advantage of the US  even as the country ran a record trade surplus of US$31.05 billion with the US in August.         If one side had been taken advantage of all the time  could such business relations have continued? Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage of   Zhong said.        The conflict between the two countries has now gone beyond trade  with Trump’s accusations that China is attempting to interfere in the 2018 US midterm congressional elections. Vice-President Mike Pence also stepped up the attack by condemning Beijing for using  every tool at its disposal  to undermine the US political system.        Pence also warned American companies  including tech giant Alphabet  which owns Google  to disengage from China.Trump rips up the trade playbook to take on China        Donna Borak  CNN        Updated 1037 GMT (1837 HKT) October 9  2018        Bali  Indonesia (CNN)President Donald Trump wants a deal with China — just not anytime soon.        After announcing a revamped trade agreement with Canada and Mexico last week  Trump reeled off a list of other countries that he said had given in to US demands to hold talks or make a deal  South Korea  Japan  the European Union.    He scoffed at those  babies out there  who worried about the effects of tariffs  suggesting that  we wouldn  t be talking about a deal  with Canada and Mexico without his confrontational approach.    The trade war will hit US and Chinese growth next year  the IMF warns     That  s going to embolden him to impose more tariffs and threaten more in the hopes of getting a better deal out of China   said Edward Alden  a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.    Trump s no-holds-barred strategy on China is likely take center stage this week at a summit of global finance chiefs and central bankers in Bali  Indonesia. And it ll be up to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  the president s top economic envoy  to argue the US case as warnings intensify about the damage a protracted trade war could do to global economic growth.     The stakes are high   Christine Lagarde  the managing director of the International Monetary Fund  said last week.  We need to work together to de-escalate and resolve the current trade disputes.      Coalition of the willing     If the Trump administration can get the European Union and Japan on side following the recent trade deals with South Korea  Canada and Mexico  that s likely to strengthen the US negotiating position with Beijing  top administration officials argue.    US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA        US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA 01 58     We are talking to the European Union again  we are talking to Japan again  and we are moving to what I have characterized as a trade coalition of the willing to confront China   Larry Kudlow  Trump  s chief economic adviser  said last week.    But talks with Europe and Japan are still in the early stages. And French President Emmanuel Macron said last month that Europe shouldn t sign trade deals with any country that doesn t comply with the Paris Agreement on climate change  a clear reference to the United States.    The Trump administration s approach to building a coalition against Beijing is a break from the old playbook of working collaboratively with allies to address mutual concerns.    Other big economies like the European Union and Japan share some of the main US grievances with China  including intellectual property theft and pressure on foreign companies to hand over technology to Chinese partners. But Trump slapped tariffs on key allies at the same time as stepping up his campaign against China  which some analysts suggest has weakened any potential united front.    The Trump administration has imposed new tariffs on about half of China&#39;s annual goods exports to the United States.    Souring relationship    Trump has made clear he s in no rush to restart talks with Beijing anytime soon. Instead  he has threatened to impose an even bigger wave of tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese products. That would mean the US measures effectively cover all the goods China sells to the United States each year.     I  m using them to negotiate   Trump said of the tariffs.  And hopefully  we can make a great deal with China — a fair deal and a reciprocal deal.     Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Details of the revised pact with Canada and Mexico  which is set to replace NAFTA  show that the US government is also trying other ways to amplify the pressure on China.    Tucked in the new agreement is a requirement that each country inform the others if it wants to start free trade negotiations with a  non-market economy   a clear reference to China. The other countries would also be able to review any potential free trade deal with China.    That move has upset Beijing  further souring the relationship between the two economic superpowers.    In a frank exchange of views in Beijing on Monday  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the United States should immediately stop its  wrong remarks and actions   including the trade war. Pompeo responded that the two countries have a  fundamental disagreement  and that the United States has  great concerns about actions that China has taken.      How much pain are they willing to endure?     Neither side is showing signs of backing down.    The United States  whose economy relies less on exports than China s  is faring better so far. China s economy had already started slowing down this year and its stock markets and currency have slumped as the trade conflict has escalated.    China is pumping more cash into its economy as the trade war heats up     The question is  How much pain are they willing to endure?  said Thomas Bernes  a distinguished fellow for the Centre for International Governance Innovation.  They will be looking to the midterm elections to see if there is going to be a rejection of Trumpism or whether they he gains strength and remains in power.     For its part  the Trump administration appears willing to maintain the pressure for as long as it can.     We have changed the paradigm   US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said last month.  We have tariffs in place  and the president is not going to let this go along when you have forced transfer of intellectual property.     Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires at the end of November.    But with Beijing unwilling to give ground on US demands that it change fundamental parts of its economic policy  the prospects of reaching a deal anytime soon appear slim.     It is still hard to see how a further escalation of the trade conflict with China will be avoided   Andrew Hunter  US economist at research firm Capital Economics said in a note to clients last week.Is China or Russia America’s Defining Rival?    The debate doesn’t just have consequences for U.S. foreign policy—it will define the next decades of domestic affairs as well.        OCT 9  2018        Late last week  as most of America’s political class was transfixed by the denouement of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle  Vice President Mike Pence gave a wide-ranging address on the U.S. relationship with China  and why the Trump administration is committed to opposing its expansionist designs. For the most part  it was a familiar litany of complaints about China’s efforts to coerce its neighbors in the western Pacific  its trade abuses  its hostility to religious freedom  and its support of unsavory regimes around the world. Yet halfway through his remarks  the vice president shifted his emphasis  turning from all the various ways the Chinese party-state was acting in the world outside America’s borders to how it was seeking to influence political and cultural life inside them.        Specifically  Pence warned that  China wants a different American president   and that Beijing was mobilizing  covert actors  front groups  and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policies  to that end. By now  it has become routine for the heads of U.S. multinationals to condemn the Trump administration’s trade policies  and the fact that they’d do so is perfectly understandable. China’s violent labor repression and its policy of subsidizing industrialists at the expense of households have proved highly advantageous to those seeking a disciplined and relatively low-cost workforce  regardless of their citizenship. According to Pence  however  there is another layer to the politics of trade  namely that senior Chinese officials are threatening to punish business leaders who fail to denounce U.S. tariffs. He pointed to the rising sophistication with which Beijing exploits America’s domestic political cleavages  as evidenced by its targeting of retaliatory tariffs to regions and industries believed crucial to the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections  and its shrewd efforts to silence criticism of Chinese policies on university campuses desperate for Chinese money.

The implicit question raised by both Pence and Trump is this  Should we be more worried about Chinese meddling than Russian meddling? Some observers have dismissed the idea  warning that it represents a distraction from ongoing Russian meddling. Others acknowledge that while China’s efforts to influence democratic outcomes are different in character from Russia’s approach  which Beijing seems to see as  ineffective and counterproductive   there is no question that  as Rush Doshi and Robert D. Williams of the Brookings Institution have cautiously observed   China has long pursued a wide-ranging and very real campaign to influence the political and informational environment of other countries  including the United States.         Needless to say  one could see both Russia and China as dangerous rivals  and I certainly do. But in an age of intensifying partisan enmity  when large numbers of Americans question the legitimacy of the Trump presidency while similarly large numbers see Donald Trump as their champion  it is fitting that Democrats and Republicans can’t bring themselves to agree on which of the world’s revanchist powers ought to serve as what you might call our orienting enemy or  as the Harvard political scientist Samuel P. Huntington once put it  the  other  that gives our grand strategy its ideological shape.        In 1997  not long after the collapse of the Soviet bloc  Huntington warned that American grand strategy was losing its coherence in part because America’s creedal identity had long been defined in opposition to just such an  other.  In the early days of the republic  he observed  it was Britain that offered this necessary contrast  While the British lived under tyranny and hierarchy  Americans told themselves  we enjoyed freedom and equality. So  too  in later years did Wilhelmine Germany provide an orienting rivalry  and then the Nazi and Soviet totalitarianisms that ravaged the world for much of the 20th century. The Soviet Union’s demise therefore prompted a kind of identity crisis.  While wars at times may have a divisive effect on society   wrote Huntington   a common enemy can often help to promote identity and cohesion among people. The weakening or absence of a common enemy can do just the reverse.         What Huntington did not quite anticipate is that America would find itself divided between two creedal identities—one right  one left—each of which defines itself against a different enemy. This is a pattern that has obtained in earlier eras. Consider that the founding generation was bitterly divided over whether Revolutionary France or the British Empire represented the greater threat to American liberty. The early 1900s saw debates between Germanophiles  many of whom were progressives and socialists of German extraction  and Anglophiles who embraced the idea of a world order jointly administered by a British-American condominium. The difference now is that even in the supposed twilight of American global leadership  our creedal clashes reverberate around the world.        And so the United States finds itself in the midst of not one but two cold wars. To cosmopolitan liberals  it is Russia that serves as America’s chief geopolitical adversary. Even in Russia’s weakened and impoverished state  they fear the deftness with which its operatives act in connivance with illiberal elements in the world’s diverse market democracies to undermine them from within. Nationalist conservatives see rising Chinese power as the far graver threat to American interests  and they are increasingly open to wielding the power of the state to resist and counter Beijing’s depredations  despite the cost to economic freedom that may well result.        It is not difficult to understand why Russia has such a hold on the liberal imagination. There is at this point little doubt that the Russian state has sought to sow chaos and division in the U.S. and democratic Europe  in part out of a conviction that Western liberals have done much the same throughout post-Soviet Eurasia. Though the extent to which Russian information operations influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election is contested  the notion that it played a decisive role is an article of faith among Trump’s liberal critics  for whom Vladimir Putin is the perfect foil.        The Putin ascendancy has been defined by  in the first place  rank kleptocracy  but also by an explicit and often deranged antiliberalism  in which the chief enemies of the Russian nation are the forces of gay rights and feminism. As the American author Timothy Snyder has argued  Putinism’s crusade against gay rights was designed  to transform demands for democracy into a nebulous threat to Russian innocence  voting = west = sodomy.  While defining liberalism as the politics of sexual perversion  Putin defines his own regime as the defender of masculinity and traditionalism  and as the natural ally of all those who defend state sovereignty against the supposed cosmopolitan conspiracy to dissolve the natural family. In short  Putin invites cosmopolitan liberals to see Russia under his rule as their enemy  just as he invites right-wing populists in the Western democracies to see him as a friend.        An America that defines itself against Putin’s Russia is an America that would redouble its commitment to cosmopolitan liberalism  including a commitment to free and open trade on a multilateral  nondiscriminatory basis  while marginalizing nationalist conservatism as retrograde. nato would be shored up  which is all to the good  but the U.S. would adopt a warier attitude toward populist parties in Central and Eastern Europe  a stance that could see these democracies drift further out of the American orbit.        And as for the Chinese party-state  it wouldn’t exactly be a friend  especially in light of its hostility to civil liberties  but the Chinese Communist Party’s stated commitment to combating climate change and antitrade nationalist politicians would lend it a certain prestige and legitimacy. Shortly after Trump’s inauguration  Xi Jinping presented himself as a defender of a rules-based international order  the Paris agreement  and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran  and in doing so he won himself admirers in elite circles  especially among those unaware of the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims for political crimes. Over time  a U.S. grand strategy rooted in cosmopolitan liberalism might grow warier of Chinese power  especially if the Chinese party-state were to become more explicitly nationalist as it sees less of a need to cater to cosmopolitan-liberal sensibilities  as seems likely. But by then the economic integration of the Western democracies with China might be irreversible  and Beijing would have the upper hand.        What would it mean for the U.S. to instead choose China as its  other   as nationalist conservatives would have it? One early indication comes from a recent report from the Department of Defense  which details America’s growing dependence on China’s manufacturing base  and the threat this poses to the country’s war-fighting capabilities. In the 1990s and 2000s  market conservatives could point to the Soviet collapse as an indictment of statism  and to global economic integration as an unambiguous good. Many of these market conservatives now find themselves making common cause with cosmopolitan liberals while nationalist conservatives rethink their commitment to laissez-faire  with an eye toward meeting the challenge posed by a Chinese party-state that sees industrial progress as central to its strategic ambitions. If Beijing  not Moscow  is public enemy No. 1  it is vital that the U.S. boost public investment in infrastructure and human capital  and that it steer U.S. firms to build resilient supply chains based in the Americas  not in China’s industrial heartland. Russia would still be a rival  I suspect  but it would be seen through a different lens  as a potential ally in the protracted conflict with China  as would become much clearer once Putin himself exits the scene.        Culturally  choosing China as an orienting enemy would have more ambiguous effects. One can imagine a xenophobic turn against Chinese immigrants  visitors  and students  which would have ugly consequences. Yet one can also imagine an embrace of the Chinese people on the grounds that Beijing’s authoritarianism serves a narrow elite more than it serves ordinary workers. The argument  in essence  would be that the U.S. stands against the party-state  not China as a whole  and that America would welcome a more just and inclusive Chinese government. Indeed  Pence made exactly this argument in his recent address. More broadly  an America waging a cold war on China might place a somewhat greater emphasis on cohesion and solidarity over cosmopolitanism  not least because disentangling the American and Chinese economies would entail considerable sacrifice on the part of the U.S. business elite—a sacrifice that would have to be justified in solidaristic terms.        Which enemy will we choose in the years to come? Which cold war will we wage most assiduously? The answer will depend in no small part on the outcome of the elections to come. If history is any guide  the stakes are high  and the consequences will be enduring.Chinese Media Vow to Fight Against  Insult’ from Pence  Threaten  Cold War’        8 Oct 2018        China’s state-run Global Times vowed over the weekend to fight back against  insults  from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and promised a  new Cold War  if the Trump administration forces the issue by continuing to produce  hostile reports and speeches.     The Global Times took a passive-aggressive approach in an editorial on Sunday  beginning with strong criticism of Pence’s speech at the Hudson Institute last Thursday and citing observers who compared it to Sir Winston Churchill’s  Iron Curtain  speech about the Soviet Union at the dawn of the Cold War.        The editorial soon mellowed into a reflection on high points of the relationship between America and China  such as U.S. President Richard Nixon’s opening to China  and even took some credit for helping President Ronald Reagan put the Soviet Union out of business.        The Global Times then reiterated Beijing’s standard line about how soft  democratic America stands no chance against authoritarian China in a trade war and positioned Beijing as the more mature player in a conflict Washington has not yet realized it cannot win         The US  in fact  has limited leverage to contain China. A trade war will inevitably damage the US and is a stupid choice. It’s unrealistic to establish a NATO-style organization to target China. It is impossible to isolate and contain China given its expanding business overseas and domestic markets.        It’s difficult for the White House and Congress to mobilize an anti-China campaign in US society. Gone are the days when the public was willing to take a plunge for the so-called national interest. As long as China keeps calm in the face of hysterical US political elites  the so-called Cold War will not take shape.        At such a time  China should play tai chi with the US. This is the unique strategic wisdom of the Chinese nation. We must make the US feel the pain of the trade war and not allow the US to act unscrupulously in the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits. But we must act in a calm way. China will continue to open up. A deteriorating outside world will not change that.        China is not the Soviet Union. The US cannot deal with China as it did with the Soviet Union.        That last line became a Chinese political mantra with blinding speed after Pence’s speech to the Hudson Institute was compared to Churchill’s Iron Curtain speech.        On Monday  the Global Times pronounced China hurt and confused by the  stinging  speech Pence delivered to the Hudson Institute  filled with accusations that were  vitriolic  ruthless  and delivered in terms considered far from decorous.         This second editorial invoked the  Thucydides Trap   which has become another common talking point for Chinese politicians. The Thucydides Trap is a theory that posits ruling powers almost always go to war with rising powers  usually to the regret of both nations  unless extraordinary efforts are made to avoid conflict.        Beijing’s interpretation of Thucydides is that America has a unique responsibility to welcome China as a new global superpower and refrain from protecting American dominance by attempting to  contain  China.        As far as the Chinese are concerned  they are already doing everything a rising power could possibly do to ameliorate the concerns of the aging world hegemon  and they cannot understand why the Trump administration suddenly decided to make a  U-turn  at the urging of  hardliners  and commence efforts to contain China.        The Global Times defended the ad China took out in the Des Moines Register in September  widely seen as a major reason for the Trump administration’s complaint about Chinese interference in U.S. elections.         Where is the U.S.’ long-hailed freedom of the press?  a state-run newspaper from one of the world’s most aggressive authoritarian regimes risibly asked. In a similar vein  the Global Times portrayed China as merely seeking to defend itself from a  U.S.-initiated trade war   as if China has not been manipulating markets and stealing technology for decades.        The Global Times concluded President Trump is beating up on China to goose Republican turnout for the midterm elections and distract from  the Russiagate scandal          The reason that the Trump administration deliberately chose this timing – when China-US trade tensions are ratcheting up – to deliver the inflammatory speech is the upcoming US midterm elections.        Trump knows that playing the China card is always the safest option. It cannot only divert domestic attention from the Russiagate scandal and shift the political pressure from the president but also incite ordinary voters.        These unfounded accusations show that the understanding and judgment of the Trump administration on Sino-US relations are unprofessional  shallow and indiscreet  which is most worrying. The worsening atmosphere toward China in the US not only affects American public’ opinion on the country but also endangers the safety and interests of Chinese in the US.        When the leader of a state accuses other countries at will  how can he justify his reputation to improve bilateral ties? Perhaps the Trump government needs to think about how to show respect to China before requesting China to respect the US.        The Chinese appear to know the American left is very receptive to theories that President Trump relies on populist appeals to xenophobia and is desperate to distract from the investigation into  Russian collusion  in the 2016 election. Utterly messed up my life   What Chinese people really think of the trade war        The Guardian By Echo HuangOctober 9  2018        China’s ardent determination to win the trade war might not have all the public support it would like.        Since the US and China entered a trade war in earnest this year  both sides have been going tit-for-tat with increasing tariffs on goods. The US has put new tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports  while China has done the same to $110 billion worth of US goods. And while China’s running out of US goods to keep the retaliation going  its strongest weapon in this  war of national fate  with the US is the spirit of the Chinese people  according to state media.         The heroism of  being the first to show concern and the last to enjoy oneself’ has always run through Chinese blood  which also includes the spirit of  sacrificing one’s interest for the greater good of the public    said an opinion piece (link in Chinese) posted by the state-run People’s Daily on July 10.  Facing this  war of national fate ’ Chinese are deeply aware that  there’s no home without a country ’ so they are willing to bear temporary losses.         That comment doesn’t acknowledge how painful the trade war could become for common people. Economists estimate that if the latest Chinese goods to be added to the trade war see tariffs go up to 25% next year  it could shave half a percentage point off China’s growth. Online  people are sharing how they’re experiencing the impacts so far  and worrying about what’s to come.        Stocks tumble  yuan devalues    On Monday (Oct.7)  the first day after the Golden Week holiday  Chinese stocks fell sharply. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.7%—its biggest single-day loss (paywall)  in more than three months. The stock tumble came a day after China’s central bank announced that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks for the fourth time this year—a move seen as trying to boost the economy by increasing liquidity amid the trade war. In general  China’s stock markets haven’t been (paywall) taking the trade war in stride.         This has been a tough year for me. I haven’t received payments on several projects because of stock bursts   wrote a user (link in Chinese) of social media platform Weibo  who identified himself as working at a securities firm in Beijing.  The stock market’s tumble and the trade war have killed many projects. When I returned home  the village officials asked me how’s my work so far this year. My answer  sadly  was this—deleveraging  bad stock performance  and the trade war have utterly messed up my life.         REUTERS/MARIANA BAZO    Looking for new markets.    The devalued yuan has also worried many. While it could help exporters by making their goods more competitive  it makes life tougher for people who need foreign currency  for example families of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese studying abroad.         We are now kneeling to the trade war. It’s hard to see that the RMB [renminbi] can be stable in the near term. Looks like the Great Depression is going to arrive   said a Weibo comment (link in Chinese).        Snacks  oil prices up    Treats are suddenly more expensive due to tariffs  and so are daily necessities.         I ran out of nuts yesterday and wanted to top up my stock   wrote a female user (link in Chinese) based in northern Hebei province  but she found the nuts she’s used to eating every day  including pecans  commonly sourced from the US  cost her more.         I asked the shop owner   Why is it more expensive than last time?’ The owner said it’s because of the trade war   she continued   And I asked him   What’s the relationship?’ He said that he had imported lots of the nuts from overseas. This is the first time I feel the impact of the trade war.         As for Maine lobster  forget about it.        Chinese drivers are also feeling the pinch  with China putting tariffs on US oil imports in August.         I’ve deeply felt that the economic environment is not good. This year  there’s peer-to-peer lending and illegal money-raising crackdown  which also bled out a bunch of people. Now the drop has come to the real estate market…. then there’s the trade war  and oil prices keep going up. It won’t be long before I can’t afford to run my car   wrote a user (link in Chinese).        Small businesses may be harder hit than larger ones. The most recent Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index  a better gauge of sentiment at smaller  private firms than the official manufacturing PMI  declined from 50.6 in August to 50 last month  the lowest level in more than a year. A number below 50 indicates a contraction.        REUTERS    In response to US tariffs  China has put tariffs on American soybean imports.    Pessimism about the new NAFTA    People aren’t optimistic the pressure on China’s economy will ease up. In fact  the new North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiated by the US  Mexico  and Canada—now with a brand-new acronym—shows the formation of a front against China  some online commenters noted.         Why is the Chinese economy going to be difficult in the next six months?  wrote a male user (link in Chinese) of micro-blogging site Weibo  based in China’s southwestern Sichuan province. His argument that the elements that have been key to driving China’s economic growth in recent years—including infrastructure  foreign trade  and domestic demands—have all shown worrying signs.          In terms of foreign trade  this is the most worrying   he wrote.  The Americans are launching trade wars worldwide because they want to bypass the WTO [World Trade Organization] and build something new. At the end of September  the US  Canada and Mexico signed a new cooperation agreement. The agreement said if a  non-market-oriented economy  wants to enter their market  it needs the approval of all the three countries… Everyone knows who this  non-market-oriented economy’ is.         (The new NAFTA asks countries in the agreement to notify each other if they are to have trade deal talks with a  non-market  economy  and also give one another a say in the deal.)         Americans have been building an anti-China circle. In the first round  the Mexico gave in  then Canada. I am afraid that the third round is Japan  then Europe   said another (link in Chinese).  I highly suggest that China should make major adjustments to its current policies instead of listening to the opinions from so-called elites. China won’t back down in trade war with US  commerce minister        SCMP Amanda Lee        China will not cave in to US demands even if it faces further tariffs on its exports  China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan has said  signalling Beijing’s uncompromising stance in dealing with US.         There is a view in the US that so long as the US keeps increasing tariffs  China will back down. They don’t know the history and culture of China   Zhong said  in a statement published by Bloomberg News.         This unyielding nation suffered foreign bullying for many times in history  but never succumbed to it even in the most difficult conditions. China doesn’t want a trade war  but would rise up to it should it break out.         The US should not underestimate China’s resolve and will.             This is Beijing’s strongest response yet to the trade war following a release of a white paper last month detailing its stance on the trade war  in which China blamed the US for creating the tensions and painted itself as a promoter of free trade.        The strong comments from Zhong  whose ministry is in the front line of any possible talks with the US  coincide with a rapid deterioration in the ties between Beijing and Washington.        Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage ofCHINA’S COMMERCE MINISTER ZHONG SHAN    US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  on a brief visit to Beijing on Monday  had a testy exchange with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.        Wang told Pompeo the US had hurt  mutual trust  and must stop  misguided actions  against China  while Pompeo said there were  fundamental disagreements  between the two powers.        Prospects for Beijing and Washington to de-escalate their trade tensions are not bright.        The two sides have locked horns in levying punitive tariffs against each other and there are gaping differences over a slew of issues from intellectual property rights to the role of state-owned enterprises.            The US initially imposed a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion worth of Chinese imports  and in September added a 10 per cent tariff on an additional US$200 billion of Chinese products  with the tariff rate set to rise to 25 per cent on January 1 if China does not make trade concessions.        China’s central bank to pump US$110 billion into economy as US trade war intensifies    US President Donald Trump has also threatened to extend punitive tariffs to all Chinese imports.        China retaliated with a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion of US imports and variable tariffs of 5 per cent to 10 per cent on a further US$60 billion of US imports.        China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi (left) and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a testy exchange on Monday in Beijing. Photo  AP    Washington is demanding China change its trade practices of forcing US businesses to transfer technologies and of subsidising state-owned enterprises.        Zhong reiterated Beijing’s line that China does not steal technology from US firms.         I want to emphasise that China’s laws and regulations do not contain any requirement for technology transfer and that companies’ purchases of technologies and patents are pure market behaviour   he said.         China’s economic development  and science and technological progress are owed to reform and opening up and the endeavours of the Chinese people.         As US turns up heat on China  trade war moves beyond tariffs to new battlefronts    Zhong also argued that China never  took advantage of the US  even as the country ran a record trade surplus of US$31.05 billion with the US in August.         If one side had been taken advantage of all the time  could such business relations have continued? Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage of   Zhong said.        The conflict between the two countries has now gone beyond trade  with Trump’s accusations that China is attempting to interfere in the 2018 US midterm congressional elections. Vice-President Mike Pence also stepped up the attack by condemning Beijing for using  every tool at its disposal  to undermine the US political system.        Pence also warned American companies  including tech giant Alphabet  which owns Google  to disengage from China.Trump rips up the trade playbook to take on China        Donna Borak  CNN        Updated 1037 GMT (1837 HKT) October 9  2018        Bali  Indonesia (CNN)President Donald Trump wants a deal with China — just not anytime soon.        After announcing a revamped trade agreement with Canada and Mexico last week  Trump reeled off a list of other countries that he said had given in to US demands to hold talks or make a deal  South Korea  Japan  the European Union.    He scoffed at those  babies out there  who worried about the effects of tariffs  suggesting that  we wouldn  t be talking about a deal  with Canada and Mexico without his confrontational approach.    The trade war will hit US and Chinese growth next year  the IMF warns     That  s going to embolden him to impose more tariffs and threaten more in the hopes of getting a better deal out of China   said Edward Alden  a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.    Trump s no-holds-barred strategy on China is likely take center stage this week at a summit of global finance chiefs and central bankers in Bali  Indonesia. And it ll be up to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  the president s top economic envoy  to argue the US case as warnings intensify about the damage a protracted trade war could do to global economic growth.     The stakes are high   Christine Lagarde  the managing director of the International Monetary Fund  said last week.  We need to work together to de-escalate and resolve the current trade disputes.      Coalition of the willing     If the Trump administration can get the European Union and Japan on side following the recent trade deals with South Korea  Canada and Mexico  that s likely to strengthen the US negotiating position with Beijing  top administration officials argue.    US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA        US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA 01 58     We are talking to the European Union again  we are talking to Japan again  and we are moving to what I have characterized as a trade coalition of the willing to confront China   Larry Kudlow  Trump  s chief economic adviser  said last week.    But talks with Europe and Japan are still in the early stages. And French President Emmanuel Macron said last month that Europe shouldn t sign trade deals with any country that doesn t comply with the Paris Agreement on climate change  a clear reference to the United States.    The Trump administration s approach to building a coalition against Beijing is a break from the old playbook of working collaboratively with allies to address mutual concerns.    Other big economies like the European Union and Japan share some of the main US grievances with China  including intellectual property theft and pressure on foreign companies to hand over technology to Chinese partners. But Trump slapped tariffs on key allies at the same time as stepping up his campaign against China  which some analysts suggest has weakened any potential united front.    The Trump administration has imposed new tariffs on about half of China&#39;s annual goods exports to the United States.    Souring relationship    Trump has made clear he s in no rush to restart talks with Beijing anytime soon. Instead  he has threatened to impose an even bigger wave of tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese products. That would mean the US measures effectively cover all the goods China sells to the United States each year.     I  m using them to negotiate   Trump said of the tariffs.  And hopefully  we can make a great deal with China — a fair deal and a reciprocal deal.     Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Details of the revised pact with Canada and Mexico  which is set to replace NAFTA  show that the US government is also trying other ways to amplify the pressure on China.    Tucked in the new agreement is a requirement that each country inform the others if it wants to start free trade negotiations with a  non-market economy   a clear reference to China. The other countries would also be able to review any potential free trade deal with China.    That move has upset Beijing  further souring the relationship between the two economic superpowers.    In a frank exchange of views in Beijing on Monday  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the United States should immediately stop its  wrong remarks and actions   including the trade war. Pompeo responded that the two countries have a  fundamental disagreement  and that the United States has  great concerns about actions that China has taken.      How much pain are they willing to endure?     Neither side is showing signs of backing down.    The United States  whose economy relies less on exports than China s  is faring better so far. China s economy had already started slowing down this year and its stock markets and currency have slumped as the trade conflict has escalated.    China is pumping more cash into its economy as the trade war heats up     The question is  How much pain are they willing to endure?  said Thomas Bernes  a distinguished fellow for the Centre for International Governance Innovation.  They will be looking to the midterm elections to see if there is going to be a rejection of Trumpism or whether they he gains strength and remains in power.     For its part  the Trump administration appears willing to maintain the pressure for as long as it can.     We have changed the paradigm   US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said last month.  We have tariffs in place  and the president is not going to let this go along when you have forced transfer of intellectual property.     Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires at the end of November.    But with Beijing unwilling to give ground on US demands that it change fundamental parts of its economic policy  the prospects of reaching a deal anytime soon appear slim.     It is still hard to see how a further escalation of the trade conflict with China will be avoided   Andrew Hunter  US economist at research firm Capital Economics said in a note to clients last week.Is China or Russia America’s Defining Rival?    The debate doesn’t just have consequences for U.S. foreign policy—it will define the next decades of domestic affairs as well.        OCT 9  2018        Late last week  as most of America’s political class was transfixed by the denouement of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle  Vice President Mike Pence gave a wide-ranging address on the U.S. relationship with China  and why the Trump administration is committed to opposing its expansionist designs. For the most part  it was a familiar litany of complaints about China’s efforts to coerce its neighbors in the western Pacific  its trade abuses  its hostility to religious freedom  and its support of unsavory regimes around the world. Yet halfway through his remarks  the vice president shifted his emphasis  turning from all the various ways the Chinese party-state was acting in the world outside America’s borders to how it was seeking to influence political and cultural life inside them.        Specifically  Pence warned that  China wants a different American president   and that Beijing was mobilizing  covert actors  front groups  and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policies  to that end. By now  it has become routine for the heads of U.S. multinationals to condemn the Trump administration’s trade policies  and the fact that they’d do so is perfectly understandable. China’s violent labor repression and its policy of subsidizing industrialists at the expense of households have proved highly advantageous to those seeking a disciplined and relatively low-cost workforce  regardless of their citizenship. According to Pence  however  there is another layer to the politics of trade  namely that senior Chinese officials are threatening to punish business leaders who fail to denounce U.S. tariffs. He pointed to the rising sophistication with which Beijing exploits America’s domestic political cleavages  as evidenced by its targeting of retaliatory tariffs to regions and industries believed crucial to the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections  and its shrewd efforts to silence criticism of Chinese policies on university campuses desperate for Chinese money.

The implicit question raised by both Pence and Trump is this  Should we be more worried about Chinese meddling than Russian meddling? Some observers have dismissed the idea  warning that it represents a distraction from ongoing Russian meddling. Others acknowledge that while China’s efforts to influence democratic outcomes are different in character from Russia’s approach  which Beijing seems to see as  ineffective and counterproductive   there is no question that  as Rush Doshi and Robert D. Williams of the Brookings Institution have cautiously observed   China has long pursued a wide-ranging and very real campaign to influence the political and informational environment of other countries  including the United States.         Needless to say  one could see both Russia and China as dangerous rivals  and I certainly do. But in an age of intensifying partisan enmity  when large numbers of Americans question the legitimacy of the Trump presidency while similarly large numbers see Donald Trump as their champion  it is fitting that Democrats and Republicans can’t bring themselves to agree on which of the world’s revanchist powers ought to serve as what you might call our orienting enemy or  as the Harvard political scientist Samuel P. Huntington once put it  the  other  that gives our grand strategy its ideological shape.        In 1997  not long after the collapse of the Soviet bloc  Huntington warned that American grand strategy was losing its coherence in part because America’s creedal identity had long been defined in opposition to just such an  other.  In the early days of the republic  he observed  it was Britain that offered this necessary contrast  While the British lived under tyranny and hierarchy  Americans told themselves  we enjoyed freedom and equality. So  too  in later years did Wilhelmine Germany provide an orienting rivalry  and then the Nazi and Soviet totalitarianisms that ravaged the world for much of the 20th century. The Soviet Union’s demise therefore prompted a kind of identity crisis.  While wars at times may have a divisive effect on society   wrote Huntington   a common enemy can often help to promote identity and cohesion among people. The weakening or absence of a common enemy can do just the reverse.         What Huntington did not quite anticipate is that America would find itself divided between two creedal identities—one right  one left—each of which defines itself against a different enemy. This is a pattern that has obtained in earlier eras. Consider that the founding generation was bitterly divided over whether Revolutionary France or the British Empire represented the greater threat to American liberty. The early 1900s saw debates between Germanophiles  many of whom were progressives and socialists of German extraction  and Anglophiles who embraced the idea of a world order jointly administered by a British-American condominium. The difference now is that even in the supposed twilight of American global leadership  our creedal clashes reverberate around the world.        And so the United States finds itself in the midst of not one but two cold wars. To cosmopolitan liberals  it is Russia that serves as America’s chief geopolitical adversary. Even in Russia’s weakened and impoverished state  they fear the deftness with which its operatives act in connivance with illiberal elements in the world’s diverse market democracies to undermine them from within. Nationalist conservatives see rising Chinese power as the far graver threat to American interests  and they are increasingly open to wielding the power of the state to resist and counter Beijing’s depredations  despite the cost to economic freedom that may well result.        It is not difficult to understand why Russia has such a hold on the liberal imagination. There is at this point little doubt that the Russian state has sought to sow chaos and division in the U.S. and democratic Europe  in part out of a conviction that Western liberals have done much the same throughout post-Soviet Eurasia. Though the extent to which Russian information operations influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election is contested  the notion that it played a decisive role is an article of faith among Trump’s liberal critics  for whom Vladimir Putin is the perfect foil.        The Putin ascendancy has been defined by  in the first place  rank kleptocracy  but also by an explicit and often deranged antiliberalism  in which the chief enemies of the Russian nation are the forces of gay rights and feminism. As the American author Timothy Snyder has argued  Putinism’s crusade against gay rights was designed  to transform demands for democracy into a nebulous threat to Russian innocence  voting = west = sodomy.  While defining liberalism as the politics of sexual perversion  Putin defines his own regime as the defender of masculinity and traditionalism  and as the natural ally of all those who defend state sovereignty against the supposed cosmopolitan conspiracy to dissolve the natural family. In short  Putin invites cosmopolitan liberals to see Russia under his rule as their enemy  just as he invites right-wing populists in the Western democracies to see him as a friend.        An America that defines itself against Putin’s Russia is an America that would redouble its commitment to cosmopolitan liberalism  including a commitment to free and open trade on a multilateral  nondiscriminatory basis  while marginalizing nationalist conservatism as retrograde. nato would be shored up  which is all to the good  but the U.S. would adopt a warier attitude toward populist parties in Central and Eastern Europe  a stance that could see these democracies drift further out of the American orbit.        And as for the Chinese party-state  it wouldn’t exactly be a friend  especially in light of its hostility to civil liberties  but the Chinese Communist Party’s stated commitment to combating climate change and antitrade nationalist politicians would lend it a certain prestige and legitimacy. Shortly after Trump’s inauguration  Xi Jinping presented himself as a defender of a rules-based international order  the Paris agreement  and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran  and in doing so he won himself admirers in elite circles  especially among those unaware of the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims for political crimes. Over time  a U.S. grand strategy rooted in cosmopolitan liberalism might grow warier of Chinese power  especially if the Chinese party-state were to become more explicitly nationalist as it sees less of a need to cater to cosmopolitan-liberal sensibilities  as seems likely. But by then the economic integration of the Western democracies with China might be irreversible  and Beijing would have the upper hand.        What would it mean for the U.S. to instead choose China as its  other   as nationalist conservatives would have it? One early indication comes from a recent report from the Department of Defense  which details America’s growing dependence on China’s manufacturing base  and the threat this poses to the country’s war-fighting capabilities. In the 1990s and 2000s  market conservatives could point to the Soviet collapse as an indictment of statism  and to global economic integration as an unambiguous good. Many of these market conservatives now find themselves making common cause with cosmopolitan liberals while nationalist conservatives rethink their commitment to laissez-faire  with an eye toward meeting the challenge posed by a Chinese party-state that sees industrial progress as central to its strategic ambitions. If Beijing  not Moscow  is public enemy No. 1  it is vital that the U.S. boost public investment in infrastructure and human capital  and that it steer U.S. firms to build resilient supply chains based in the Americas  not in China’s industrial heartland. Russia would still be a rival  I suspect  but it would be seen through a different lens  as a potential ally in the protracted conflict with China  as would become much clearer once Putin himself exits the scene.        Culturally  choosing China as an orienting enemy would have more ambiguous effects. One can imagine a xenophobic turn against Chinese immigrants  visitors  and students  which would have ugly consequences. Yet one can also imagine an embrace of the Chinese people on the grounds that Beijing’s authoritarianism serves a narrow elite more than it serves ordinary workers. The argument  in essence  would be that the U.S. stands against the party-state  not China as a whole  and that America would welcome a more just and inclusive Chinese government. Indeed  Pence made exactly this argument in his recent address. More broadly  an America waging a cold war on China might place a somewhat greater emphasis on cohesion and solidarity over cosmopolitanism  not least because disentangling the American and Chinese economies would entail considerable sacrifice on the part of the U.S. business elite—a sacrifice that would have to be justified in solidaristic terms.        Which enemy will we choose in the years to come? Which cold war will we wage most assiduously? The answer will depend in no small part on the outcome of the elections to come. If history is any guide  the stakes are high  and the consequences will be enduring.Chinese Media Vow to Fight Against  Insult’ from Pence  Threaten  Cold War’        8 Oct 2018        China’s state-run Global Times vowed over the weekend to fight back against  insults  from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and promised a  new Cold War  if the Trump administration forces the issue by continuing to produce  hostile reports and speeches.     The Global Times took a passive-aggressive approach in an editorial on Sunday  beginning with strong criticism of Pence’s speech at the Hudson Institute last Thursday and citing observers who compared it to Sir Winston Churchill’s  Iron Curtain  speech about the Soviet Union at the dawn of the Cold War.        The editorial soon mellowed into a reflection on high points of the relationship between America and China  such as U.S. President Richard Nixon’s opening to China  and even took some credit for helping President Ronald Reagan put the Soviet Union out of business.        The Global Times then reiterated Beijing’s standard line about how soft  democratic America stands no chance against authoritarian China in a trade war and positioned Beijing as the more mature player in a conflict Washington has not yet realized it cannot win         The US  in fact  has limited leverage to contain China. A trade war will inevitably damage the US and is a stupid choice. It’s unrealistic to establish a NATO-style organization to target China. It is impossible to isolate and contain China given its expanding business overseas and domestic markets.        It’s difficult for the White House and Congress to mobilize an anti-China campaign in US society. Gone are the days when the public was willing to take a plunge for the so-called national interest. As long as China keeps calm in the face of hysterical US political elites  the so-called Cold War will not take shape.        At such a time  China should play tai chi with the US. This is the unique strategic wisdom of the Chinese nation. We must make the US feel the pain of the trade war and not allow the US to act unscrupulously in the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits. But we must act in a calm way. China will continue to open up. A deteriorating outside world will not change that.        China is not the Soviet Union. The US cannot deal with China as it did with the Soviet Union.        That last line became a Chinese political mantra with blinding speed after Pence’s speech to the Hudson Institute was compared to Churchill’s Iron Curtain speech.        On Monday  the Global Times pronounced China hurt and confused by the  stinging  speech Pence delivered to the Hudson Institute  filled with accusations that were  vitriolic  ruthless  and delivered in terms considered far from decorous.         This second editorial invoked the  Thucydides Trap   which has become another common talking point for Chinese politicians. The Thucydides Trap is a theory that posits ruling powers almost always go to war with rising powers  usually to the regret of both nations  unless extraordinary efforts are made to avoid conflict.        Beijing’s interpretation of Thucydides is that America has a unique responsibility to welcome China as a new global superpower and refrain from protecting American dominance by attempting to  contain  China.        As far as the Chinese are concerned  they are already doing everything a rising power could possibly do to ameliorate the concerns of the aging world hegemon  and they cannot understand why the Trump administration suddenly decided to make a  U-turn  at the urging of  hardliners  and commence efforts to contain China.        The Global Times defended the ad China took out in the Des Moines Register in September  widely seen as a major reason for the Trump administration’s complaint about Chinese interference in U.S. elections.         Where is the U.S.’ long-hailed freedom of the press?  a state-run newspaper from one of the world’s most aggressive authoritarian regimes risibly asked. In a similar vein  the Global Times portrayed China as merely seeking to defend itself from a  U.S.-initiated trade war   as if China has not been manipulating markets and stealing technology for decades.        The Global Times concluded President Trump is beating up on China to goose Republican turnout for the midterm elections and distract from  the Russiagate scandal          The reason that the Trump administration deliberately chose this timing – when China-US trade tensions are ratcheting up – to deliver the inflammatory speech is the upcoming US midterm elections.        Trump knows that playing the China card is always the safest option. It cannot only divert domestic attention from the Russiagate scandal and shift the political pressure from the president but also incite ordinary voters.        These unfounded accusations show that the understanding and judgment of the Trump administration on Sino-US relations are unprofessional  shallow and indiscreet  which is most worrying. The worsening atmosphere toward China in the US not only affects American public’ opinion on the country but also endangers the safety and interests of Chinese in the US.        When the leader of a state accuses other countries at will  how can he justify his reputation to improve bilateral ties? Perhaps the Trump government needs to think about how to show respect to China before requesting China to respect the US.        The Chinese appear to know the American left is very receptive to theories that President Trump relies on populist appeals to xenophobia and is desperate to distract from the investigation into  Russian collusion  in the 2016 election. ]'"

       "'[  Utterly messed up my life   What Chinese people really think of the trade war        The Guardian By Echo HuangOctober 9  2018        China’s ardent determination to win the trade war might not have all the public support it would like.        Since the US and China entered a trade war in earnest this year  both sides have been going tit-for-tat with increasing tariffs on goods. The US has put new tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports  while China has done the same to $110 billion worth of US goods. And while China’s running out of US goods to keep the retaliation going  its strongest weapon in this  war of national fate  with the US is the spirit of the Chinese people  according to state media.         The heroism of  being the first to show concern and the last to enjoy oneself’ has always run through Chinese blood  which also includes the spirit of  sacrificing one’s interest for the greater good of the public    said an opinion piece  link in Chinese  posted by the state-run People’s Daily on July 10.  Facing this  war of national fate ’ Chinese are deeply aware that  there’s no home without a country ’ so they are willing to bear temporary losses.         That comment doesn’t acknowledge how painful the trade war could become for common people. Economists estimate that if the latest Chinese goods to be added to the trade war see tariffs go up to 25% next year  it could shave half a percentage point off China’s growth. Online  people are sharing how they’re experiencing the impacts so far  and worrying about what’s to come.        Stocks tumble  yuan devalues    On Monday  Oct.7   the first day after the Golden Week holiday  Chinese stocks fell sharply. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.7%—its biggest single-day loss  paywall   in more than three months. The stock tumble came a day after China’s central bank announced that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks for the fourth time this year—a move seen as trying to boost the economy by increasing liquidity amid the trade war. In general  China’s stock markets haven’t been  paywall  taking the trade war in stride.         This has been a tough year for me. I haven’t received payments on several projects because of stock bursts   wrote a user  link in Chinese  of social media platform Weibo  who identified himself as working at a securities firm in Beijing.  The stock market’s tumble and the trade war have killed many projects. When I returned home  the village officials asked me how’s my work so far this year. My answer  sadly  was this—deleveraging  bad stock performance  and the trade war have utterly messed up my life.         REUTERS/MARIANA BAZO    Looking for new markets.    The devalued yuan has also worried many. While it could help exporters by making their goods more competitive  it makes life tougher for people who need foreign currency  for example families of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese studying abroad.         We are now kneeling to the trade war. It’s hard to see that the RMB [renminbi] can be stable in the near term. Looks like the Great Depression is going to arrive   said a Weibo comment  link in Chinese .        Snacks  oil prices up    Treats are suddenly more expensive due to tariffs  and so are daily necessities.         I ran out of nuts yesterday and wanted to top up my stock   wrote a female user  link in Chinese  based in northern Hebei province  but she found the nuts she’s used to eating every day  including pecans  commonly sourced from the US  cost her more.         I asked the shop owner   Why is it more expensive than last time?’ The owner said it’s because of the trade war   she continued   And I asked him   What’s the relationship?’ He said that he had imported lots of the nuts from overseas. This is the first time I feel the impact of the trade war.         As for Maine lobster  forget about it.        Chinese drivers are also feeling the pinch  with China putting tariffs on US oil imports in August.         I’ve deeply felt that the economic environment is not good. This year  there’s peer-to-peer lending and illegal money-raising crackdown  which also bled out a bunch of people. Now the drop has come to the real estate market…. then there’s the trade war  and oil prices keep going up. It won’t be long before I can’t afford to run my car   wrote a user  link in Chinese .        Small businesses may be harder hit than larger ones. The most recent Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index  a better gauge of sentiment at smaller  private firms than the official manufacturing PMI  declined from 50.6 in August to 50 last month  the lowest level in more than a year. A number below 50 indicates a contraction.        REUTERS    In response to US tariffs  China has put tariffs on American soybean imports.    Pessimism about the new NAFTA    People aren’t optimistic the pressure on China’s economy will ease up. In fact  the new North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiated by the US  Mexico  and Canada—now with a brand-new acronym—shows the formation of a front against China  some online commenters noted.         Why is the Chinese economy going to be difficult in the next six months?  wrote a male user  link in Chinese  of micro-blogging site Weibo  based in China’s southwestern Sichuan province. His argument that the elements that have been key to driving China’s economic growth in recent years—including infrastructure  foreign trade  and domestic demands—have all shown worrying signs.          In terms of foreign trade  this is the most worrying   he wrote.  The Americans are launching trade wars worldwide because they want to bypass the WTO [World Trade Organization] and build something new. At the end of September  the US  Canada and Mexico signed a new cooperation agreement. The agreement said if a  non-market-oriented economy  wants to enter their market  it needs the approval of all the three countries… Everyone knows who this  non-market-oriented economy’ is.          The new NAFTA asks countries in the agreement to notify each other if they are to have trade deal talks with a  non-market  economy  and also give one another a say in the deal.          Americans have been building an anti-China circle. In the first round  the Mexico gave in  then Canada. I am afraid that the third round is Japan  then Europe   said another  link in Chinese .  I highly suggest that China should make major adjustments to its current policies instead of listening to the opinions from so-called elites. China won’t back down in trade war with US  commerce minister        SCMP Amanda Lee        China will not cave in to US demands even if it faces further tariffs on its exports  China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan has said  signalling Beijing’s uncompromising stance in dealing with US.         There is a view in the US that so long as the US keeps increasing tariffs  China will back down. They don’t know the history and culture of China   Zhong said  in a statement published by Bloomberg News.         This unyielding nation suffered foreign bullying for many times in history  but never succumbed to it even in the most difficult conditions. China doesn’t want a trade war  but would rise up to it should it break out.         The US should not underestimate China’s resolve and will.             This is Beijing’s strongest response yet to the trade war following a release of a white paper last month detailing its stance on the trade war  in which China blamed the US for creating the tensions and painted itself as a promoter of free trade.        The strong comments from Zhong  whose ministry is in the front line of any possible talks with the US  coincide with a rapid deterioration in the ties between Beijing and Washington.        Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage ofCHINA’S COMMERCE MINISTER ZHONG SHAN    US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  on a brief visit to Beijing on Monday  had a testy exchange with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.        Wang told Pompeo the US had hurt  mutual trust  and must stop  misguided actions  against China  while Pompeo said there were  fundamental disagreements  between the two powers.        Prospects for Beijing and Washington to de-escalate their trade tensions are not bright.        The two sides have locked horns in levying punitive tariffs against each other and there are gaping differences over a slew of issues from intellectual property rights to the role of state-owned enterprises.            The US initially imposed a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion worth of Chinese imports  and in September added a 10 per cent tariff on an additional US$200 billion of Chinese products  with the tariff rate set to rise to 25 per cent on January 1 if China does not make trade concessions.        China’s central bank to pump US$110 billion into economy as US trade war intensifies    US President Donald Trump has also threatened to extend punitive tariffs to all Chinese imports.        China retaliated with a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion of US imports and variable tariffs of 5 per cent to 10 per cent on a further US$60 billion of US imports.        China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi  left  and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a testy exchange on Monday in Beijing. Photo  AP    Washington is demanding China change its trade practices of forcing US businesses to transfer technologies and of subsidising state-owned enterprises.        Zhong reiterated Beijing’s line that China does not steal technology from US firms.         I want to emphasise that China’s laws and regulations do not contain any requirement for technology transfer and that companies’ purchases of technologies and patents are pure market behaviour   he said.         China’s economic development  and science and technological progress are owed to reform and opening up and the endeavours of the Chinese people.         As US turns up heat on China  trade war moves beyond tariffs to new battlefronts    Zhong also argued that China never  took advantage of the US  even as the country ran a record trade surplus of US$31.05 billion with the US in August.         If one side had been taken advantage of all the time  could such business relations have continued? Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage of   Zhong said.        The conflict between the two countries has now gone beyond trade  with Trump’s accusations that China is attempting to interfere in the 2018 US midterm congressional elections. Vice-President Mike Pence also stepped up the attack by condemning Beijing for using  every tool at its disposal  to undermine the US political system.        Pence also warned American companies  including tech giant Alphabet  which owns Google  to disengage from China.Trump rips up the trade playbook to take on China        Donna Borak  CNN        Updated 1037 GMT  1837 HKT  October 9  2018        Bali  Indonesia  CNN President Donald Trump wants a deal with China — just not anytime soon.        After announcing a revamped trade agreement with Canada and Mexico last week  Trump reeled off a list of other countries that he said had given in to US demands to hold talks or make a deal  South Korea  Japan  the European Union.    He scoffed at those  babies out there  who worried about the effects of tariffs  suggesting that  we wouldn  t be talking about a deal  with Canada and Mexico without his confrontational approach.    The trade war will hit US and Chinese growth next year  the IMF warns     That  s going to embolden him to impose more tariffs and threaten more in the hopes of getting a better deal out of China   said Edward Alden  a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.    Trump s no-holds-barred strategy on China is likely take center stage this week at a summit of global finance chiefs and central bankers in Bali  Indonesia. And it ll be up to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  the president s top economic envoy  to argue the US case as warnings intensify about the damage a protracted trade war could do to global economic growth.     The stakes are high   Christine Lagarde  the managing director of the International Monetary Fund  said last week.  We need to work together to de-escalate and resolve the current trade disputes.      Coalition of the willing     If the Trump administration can get the European Union and Japan on side following the recent trade deals with South Korea  Canada and Mexico  that s likely to strengthen the US negotiating position with Beijing  top administration officials argue.    US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA        US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA 01 58     We are talking to the European Union again  we are talking to Japan again  and we are moving to what I have characterized as a trade coalition of the willing to confront China   Larry Kudlow  Trump  s chief economic adviser  said last week.    But talks with Europe and Japan are still in the early stages. And French President Emmanuel Macron said last month that Europe shouldn t sign trade deals with any country that doesn t comply with the Paris Agreement on climate change  a clear reference to the United States.    The Trump administration s approach to building a coalition against Beijing is a break from the old playbook of working collaboratively with allies to address mutual concerns.    Other big economies like the European Union and Japan share some of the main US grievances with China  including intellectual property theft and pressure on foreign companies to hand over technology to Chinese partners. But Trump slapped tariffs on key allies at the same time as stepping up his campaign against China  which some analysts suggest has weakened any potential united front.    The Trump administration has imposed new tariffs on about half of China&#39;s annual goods exports to the United States.    Souring relationship    Trump has made clear he s in no rush to restart talks with Beijing anytime soon. Instead  he has threatened to impose an even bigger wave of tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese products. That would mean the US measures effectively cover all the goods China sells to the United States each year.     I  m using them to negotiate   Trump said of the tariffs.  And hopefully  we can make a great deal with China — a fair deal and a reciprocal deal.     Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Details of the revised pact with Canada and Mexico  which is set to replace NAFTA  show that the US government is also trying other ways to amplify the pressure on China.    Tucked in the new agreement is a requirement that each country inform the others if it wants to start free trade negotiations with a  non-market economy   a clear reference to China. The other countries would also be able to review any potential free trade deal with China.    That move has upset Beijing  further souring the relationship between the two economic superpowers.    In a frank exchange of views in Beijing on Monday  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the United States should immediately stop its  wrong remarks and actions   including the trade war. Pompeo responded that the two countries have a  fundamental disagreement  and that the United States has  great concerns about actions that China has taken.      How much pain are they willing to endure?     Neither side is showing signs of backing down.    The United States  whose economy relies less on exports than China s  is faring better so far. China s economy had already started slowing down this year and its stock markets and currency have slumped as the trade conflict has escalated.    China is pumping more cash into its economy as the trade war heats up     The question is  How much pain are they willing to endure?  said Thomas Bernes  a distinguished fellow for the Centre for International Governance Innovation.  They will be looking to the midterm elections to see if there is going to be a rejection of Trumpism or whether they he gains strength and remains in power.     For its part  the Trump administration appears willing to maintain the pressure for as long as it can.     We have changed the paradigm   US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said last month.  We have tariffs in place  and the president is not going to let this go along when you have forced transfer of intellectual property.     Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires at the end of November.    But with Beijing unwilling to give ground on US demands that it change fundamental parts of its economic policy  the prospects of reaching a deal anytime soon appear slim.     It is still hard to see how a further escalation of the trade conflict with China will be avoided   Andrew Hunter  US economist at research firm Capital Economics said in a note to clients last week.Is China or Russia America’s Defining Rival?    The debate doesn’t just have consequences for U.S. foreign policy—it will define the next decades of domestic affairs as well.        OCT 9  2018        Late last week  as most of America’s political class was transfixed by the denouement of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle  Vice President Mike Pence gave a wide-ranging address on the U.S. relationship with China  and why the Trump administration is committed to opposing its expansionist designs. For the most part  it was a familiar litany of complaints about China’s efforts to coerce its neighbors in the western Pacific  its trade abuses  its hostility to religious freedom  and its support of unsavory regimes around the world. Yet halfway through his remarks  the vice president shifted his emphasis  turning from all the various ways the Chinese party-state was acting in the world outside America’s borders to how it was seeking to influence political and cultural life inside them.        Specifically  Pence warned that  China wants a different American president   and that Beijing was mobilizing  covert actors  front groups  and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policies  to that end. By now  it has become routine for the heads of U.S. multinationals to condemn the Trump administration’s trade policies  and the fact that they’d do so is perfectly understandable. China’s violent labor repression and its policy of subsidizing industrialists at the expense of households have proved highly advantageous to those seeking a disciplined and relatively low-cost workforce  regardless of their citizenship. According to Pence  however  there is another layer to the politics of trade  namely that senior Chinese officials are threatening to punish business leaders who fail to denounce U.S. tariffs. He pointed to the rising sophistication with which Beijing exploits America’s domestic political cleavages  as evidenced by its targeting of retaliatory tariffs to regions and industries believed crucial to the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections  and its shrewd efforts to silence criticism of Chinese policies on university campuses desperate for Chinese money.

Medicare for All’ Is a Fantasy    REIHAN SALAM    All of this was in keeping with President Donald Trump’s blunt insistence that  we’ve found that China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election coming up in November against my administration   and  more pointedly  that  they do not want me—or us—to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade.         The implicit question raised by both Pence and Trump is this  Should we be more worried about Chinese meddling than Russian meddling? Some observers have dismissed the idea  warning that it represents a distraction from ongoing Russian meddling. Others acknowledge that while China’s efforts to influence democratic outcomes are different in character from Russia’s approach  which Beijing seems to see as  ineffective and counterproductive   there is no question that  as Rush Doshi and Robert D. Williams of the Brookings Institution have cautiously observed   China has long pursued a wide-ranging and very real campaign to influence the political and informational environment of other countries  including the United States.         Needless to say  one could see both Russia and China as dangerous rivals  and I certainly do. But in an age of intensifying partisan enmity  when large numbers of Americans question the legitimacy of the Trump presidency while similarly large numbers see Donald Trump as their champion  it is fitting that Democrats and Republicans can’t bring themselves to agree on which of the world’s revanchist powers ought to serve as what you might call our orienting enemy or  as the Harvard political scientist Samuel P. Huntington once put it  the  other  that gives our grand strategy its ideological shape.        In 1997  not long after the collapse of the Soviet bloc  Huntington warned that American grand strategy was losing its coherence in part because America’s creedal identity had long been defined in opposition to just such an  other.  In the early days of the republic  he observed  it was Britain that offered this necessary contrast  While the British lived under tyranny and hierarchy  Americans told themselves  we enjoyed freedom and equality. So  too  in later years did Wilhelmine Germany provide an orienting rivalry  and then the Nazi and Soviet totalitarianisms that ravaged the world for much of the 20th century. The Soviet Union’s demise therefore prompted a kind of identity crisis.  While wars at times may have a divisive effect on society   wrote Huntington   a common enemy can often help to promote identity and cohesion among people. The weakening or absence of a common enemy can do just the reverse.         What Huntington did not quite anticipate is that America would find itself divided between two creedal identities—one right  one left—each of which defines itself against a different enemy. This is a pattern that has obtained in earlier eras. Consider that the founding generation was bitterly divided over whether Revolutionary France or the British Empire represented the greater threat to American liberty. The early 1900s saw debates between Germanophiles  many of whom were progressives and socialists of German extraction  and Anglophiles who embraced the idea of a world order jointly administered by a British-American condominium. The difference now is that even in the supposed twilight of American global leadership  our creedal clashes reverberate around the world.        And so the United States finds itself in the midst of not one but two cold wars. To cosmopolitan liberals  it is Russia that serves as America’s chief geopolitical adversary. Even in Russia’s weakened and impoverished state  they fear the deftness with which its operatives act in connivance with illiberal elements in the world’s diverse market democracies to undermine them from within. Nationalist conservatives see rising Chinese power as the far graver threat to American interests  and they are increasingly open to wielding the power of the state to resist and counter Beijing’s depredations  despite the cost to economic freedom that may well result.        It is not difficult to understand why Russia has such a hold on the liberal imagination. There is at this point little doubt that the Russian state has sought to sow chaos and division in the U.S. and democratic Europe  in part out of a conviction that Western liberals have done much the same throughout post-Soviet Eurasia. Though the extent to which Russian information operations influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election is contested  the notion that it played a decisive role is an article of faith among Trump’s liberal critics  for whom Vladimir Putin is the perfect foil.        The Putin ascendancy has been defined by  in the first place  rank kleptocracy  but also by an explicit and often deranged antiliberalism  in which the chief enemies of the Russian nation are the forces of gay rights and feminism. As the American author Timothy Snyder has argued  Putinism’s crusade against gay rights was designed  to transform demands for democracy into a nebulous threat to Russian innocence  voting = west = sodomy.  While defining liberalism as the politics of sexual perversion  Putin defines his own regime as the defender of masculinity and traditionalism  and as the natural ally of all those who defend state sovereignty against the supposed cosmopolitan conspiracy to dissolve the natural family. In short  Putin invites cosmopolitan liberals to see Russia under his rule as their enemy  just as he invites right-wing populists in the Western democracies to see him as a friend.        An America that defines itself against Putin’s Russia is an America that would redouble its commitment to cosmopolitan liberalism  including a commitment to free and open trade on a multilateral  nondiscriminatory basis  while marginalizing nationalist conservatism as retrograde. nato would be shored up  which is all to the good  but the U.S. would adopt a warier attitude toward populist parties in Central and Eastern Europe  a stance that could see these democracies drift further out of the American orbit.        And as for the Chinese party-state  it wouldn’t exactly be a friend  especially in light of its hostility to civil liberties  but the Chinese Communist Party’s stated commitment to combating climate change and antitrade nationalist politicians would lend it a certain prestige and legitimacy. Shortly after Trump’s inauguration  Xi Jinping presented himself as a defender of a rules-based international order  the Paris agreement  and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran  and in doing so he won himself admirers in elite circles  especially among those unaware of the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims for political crimes. Over time  a U.S. grand strategy rooted in cosmopolitan liberalism might grow warier of Chinese power  especially if the Chinese party-state were to become more explicitly nationalist as it sees less of a need to cater to cosmopolitan-liberal sensibilities  as seems likely. But by then the economic integration of the Western democracies with China might be irreversible  and Beijing would have the upper hand.        What would it mean for the U.S. to instead choose China as its  other   as nationalist conservatives would have it? One early indication comes from a recent report from the Department of Defense  which details America’s growing dependence on China’s manufacturing base  and the threat this poses to the country’s war-fighting capabilities. In the 1990s and 2000s  market conservatives could point to the Soviet collapse as an indictment of statism  and to global economic integration as an unambiguous good. Many of these market conservatives now find themselves making common cause with cosmopolitan liberals while nationalist conservatives rethink their commitment to laissez-faire  with an eye toward meeting the challenge posed by a Chinese party-state that sees industrial progress as central to its strategic ambitions. If Beijing  not Moscow  is public enemy No. 1  it is vital that the U.S. boost public investment in infrastructure and human capital  and that it steer U.S. firms to build resilient supply chains based in the Americas  not in China’s industrial heartland. Russia would still be a rival  I suspect  but it would be seen through a different lens  as a potential ally in the protracted conflict with China  as would become much clearer once Putin himself exits the scene.        Culturally  choosing China as an orienting enemy would have more ambiguous effects. One can imagine a xenophobic turn against Chinese immigrants  visitors  and students  which would have ugly consequences. Yet one can also imagine an embrace of the Chinese people on the grounds that Beijing’s authoritarianism serves a narrow elite more than it serves ordinary workers. The argument  in essence  would be that the U.S. stands against the party-state  not China as a whole  and that America would welcome a more just and inclusive Chinese government. Indeed  Pence made exactly this argument in his recent address. More broadly  an America waging a cold war on China might place a somewhat greater emphasis on cohesion and solidarity over cosmopolitanism  not least because disentangling the American and Chinese economies would entail considerable sacrifice on the part of the U.S. business elite—a sacrifice that would have to be justified in solidaristic terms.        Which enemy will we choose in the years to come? Which cold war will we wage most assiduously? The answer will depend in no small part on the outcome of the elections to come. If history is any guide  the stakes are high  and the consequences will be enduring.Chinese Media Vow to Fight Against  Insult’ from Pence  Threaten  Cold War’        8 Oct 2018        China’s state-run Global Times vowed over the weekend to fight back against  insults  from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and promised a  new Cold War  if the Trump administration forces the issue by continuing to produce  hostile reports and speeches.     The Global Times took a passive-aggressive approach in an editorial on Sunday  beginning with strong criticism of Pence’s speech at the Hudson Institute last Thursday and citing observers who compared it to Sir Winston Churchill’s  Iron Curtain  speech about the Soviet Union at the dawn of the Cold War.        The editorial soon mellowed into a reflection on high points of the relationship between America and China  such as U.S. President Richard Nixon’s opening to China  and even took some credit for helping President Ronald Reagan put the Soviet Union out of business.        The Global Times then reiterated Beijing’s standard line about how soft  democratic America stands no chance against authoritarian China in a trade war and positioned Beijing as the more mature player in a conflict Washington has not yet realized it cannot win         The US  in fact  has limited leverage to contain China. A trade war will inevitably damage the US and is a stupid choice. It’s unrealistic to establish a NATO-style organization to target China. It is impossible to isolate and contain China given its expanding business overseas and domestic markets.        It’s difficult for the White House and Congress to mobilize an anti-China campaign in US society. Gone are the days when the public was willing to take a plunge for the so-called national interest. As long as China keeps calm in the face of hysterical US political elites  the so-called Cold War will not take shape.        At such a time  China should play tai chi with the US. This is the unique strategic wisdom of the Chinese nation. We must make the US feel the pain of the trade war and not allow the US to act unscrupulously in the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits. But we must act in a calm way. China will continue to open up. A deteriorating outside world will not change that.        China is not the Soviet Union. The US cannot deal with China as it did with the Soviet Union.        That last line became a Chinese political mantra with blinding speed after Pence’s speech to the Hudson Institute was compared to Churchill’s Iron Curtain speech.        On Monday  the Global Times pronounced China hurt and confused by the  stinging  speech Pence delivered to the Hudson Institute  filled with accusations that were  vitriolic  ruthless  and delivered in terms considered far from decorous.         This second editorial invoked the  Thucydides Trap   which has become another common talking point for Chinese politicians. The Thucydides Trap is a theory that posits ruling powers almost always go to war with rising powers  usually to the regret of both nations  unless extraordinary efforts are made to avoid conflict.        Beijing’s interpretation of Thucydides is that America has a unique responsibility to welcome China as a new global superpower and refrain from protecting American dominance by attempting to  contain  China.        As far as the Chinese are concerned  they are already doing everything a rising power could possibly do to ameliorate the concerns of the aging world hegemon  and they cannot understand why the Trump administration suddenly decided to make a  U-turn  at the urging of  hardliners  and commence efforts to contain China.        The Global Times defended the ad China took out in the Des Moines Register in September  widely seen as a major reason for the Trump administration’s complaint about Chinese interference in U.S. elections.         Where is the U.S.’ long-hailed freedom of the press?  a state-run newspaper from one of the world’s most aggressive authoritarian regimes risibly asked. In a similar vein  the Global Times portrayed China as merely seeking to defend itself from a  U.S.-initiated trade war   as if China has not been manipulating markets and stealing technology for decades.        The Global Times concluded President Trump is beating up on China to goose Republican turnout for the midterm elections and distract from  the Russiagate scandal          The reason that the Trump administration deliberately chose this timing – when China-US trade tensions are ratcheting up – to deliver the inflammatory speech is the upcoming US midterm elections.        Trump knows that playing the China card is always the safest option. It cannot only divert domestic attention from the Russiagate scandal and shift the political pressure from the president but also incite ordinary voters.        These unfounded accusations show that the understanding and judgment of the Trump administration on Sino-US relations are unprofessional  shallow and indiscreet  which is most worrying. The worsening atmosphere toward China in the US not only affects American public’ opinion on the country but also endangers the safety and interests of Chinese in the US.        When the leader of a state accuses other countries at will  how can he justify his reputation to improve bilateral ties? Perhaps the Trump government needs to think about how to show respect to China before requesting China to respect the US.        The Chinese appear to know the American left is very receptive to theories that President Trump relies on populist appeals to xenophobia and is desperate to distract from the investigation into  Russian collusion  in the 2016 election. Utterly messed up my life   What Chinese people really think of the trade war        The Guardian By Echo HuangOctober 9  2018        China’s ardent determination to win the trade war might not have all the public support it would like.        Since the US and China entered a trade war in earnest this year  both sides have been going tit-for-tat with increasing tariffs on goods. The US has put new tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports  while China has done the same to $110 billion worth of US goods. And while China’s running out of US goods to keep the retaliation going  its strongest weapon in this  war of national fate  with the US is the spirit of the Chinese people  according to state media.         The heroism of  being the first to show concern and the last to enjoy oneself’ has always run through Chinese blood  which also includes the spirit of  sacrificing one’s interest for the greater good of the public    said an opinion piece  link in Chinese  posted by the state-run People’s Daily on July 10.  Facing this  war of national fate ’ Chinese are deeply aware that  there’s no home without a country ’ so they are willing to bear temporary losses.         That comment doesn’t acknowledge how painful the trade war could become for common people. Economists estimate that if the latest Chinese goods to be added to the trade war see tariffs go up to 25% next year  it could shave half a percentage point off China’s growth. Online  people are sharing how they’re experiencing the impacts so far  and worrying about what’s to come.        Stocks tumble  yuan devalues    On Monday  Oct.7   the first day after the Golden Week holiday  Chinese stocks fell sharply. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.7%—its biggest single-day loss  paywall   in more than three months. The stock tumble came a day after China’s central bank announced that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks for the fourth time this year—a move seen as trying to boost the economy by increasing liquidity amid the trade war. In general  China’s stock markets haven’t been  paywall  taking the trade war in stride.         This has been a tough year for me. I haven’t received payments on several projects because of stock bursts   wrote a user  link in Chinese  of social media platform Weibo  who identified himself as working at a securities firm in Beijing.  The stock market’s tumble and the trade war have killed many projects. When I returned home  the village officials asked me how’s my work so far this year. My answer  sadly  was this—deleveraging  bad stock performance  and the trade war have utterly messed up my life.         REUTERS/MARIANA BAZO    Looking for new markets.    The devalued yuan has also worried many. While it could help exporters by making their goods more competitive  it makes life tougher for people who need foreign currency  for example families of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese studying abroad.         We are now kneeling to the trade war. It’s hard to see that the RMB [renminbi] can be stable in the near term. Looks like the Great Depression is going to arrive   said a Weibo comment  link in Chinese .        Snacks  oil prices up    Treats are suddenly more expensive due to tariffs  and so are daily necessities.         I ran out of nuts yesterday and wanted to top up my stock   wrote a female user  link in Chinese  based in northern Hebei province  but she found the nuts she’s used to eating every day  including pecans  commonly sourced from the US  cost her more.         I asked the shop owner   Why is it more expensive than last time?’ The owner said it’s because of the trade war   she continued   And I asked him   What’s the relationship?’ He said that he had imported lots of the nuts from overseas. This is the first time I feel the impact of the trade war.         As for Maine lobster  forget about it.        Chinese drivers are also feeling the pinch  with China putting tariffs on US oil imports in August.         I’ve deeply felt that the economic environment is not good. This year  there’s peer-to-peer lending and illegal money-raising crackdown  which also bled out a bunch of people. Now the drop has come to the real estate market…. then there’s the trade war  and oil prices keep going up. It won’t be long before I can’t afford to run my car   wrote a user  link in Chinese .        Small businesses may be harder hit than larger ones. The most recent Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index  a better gauge of sentiment at smaller  private firms than the official manufacturing PMI  declined from 50.6 in August to 50 last month  the lowest level in more than a year. A number below 50 indicates a contraction.        REUTERS    In response to US tariffs  China has put tariffs on American soybean imports.    Pessimism about the new NAFTA    People aren’t optimistic the pressure on China’s economy will ease up. In fact  the new North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiated by the US  Mexico  and Canada—now with a brand-new acronym—shows the formation of a front against China  some online commenters noted.         Why is the Chinese economy going to be difficult in the next six months?  wrote a male user  link in Chinese  of micro-blogging site Weibo  based in China’s southwestern Sichuan province. His argument that the elements that have been key to driving China’s economic growth in recent years—including infrastructure  foreign trade  and domestic demands—have all shown worrying signs.          In terms of foreign trade  this is the most worrying   he wrote.  The Americans are launching trade wars worldwide because they want to bypass the WTO [World Trade Organization] and build something new. At the end of September  the US  Canada and Mexico signed a new cooperation agreement. The agreement said if a  non-market-oriented economy  wants to enter their market  it needs the approval of all the three countries… Everyone knows who this  non-market-oriented economy’ is.          The new NAFTA asks countries in the agreement to notify each other if they are to have trade deal talks with a  non-market  economy  and also give one another a say in the deal.          Americans have been building an anti-China circle. In the first round  the Mexico gave in  then Canada. I am afraid that the third round is Japan  then Europe   said another  link in Chinese .  I highly suggest that China should make major adjustments to its current policies instead of listening to the opinions from so-called elites. China won’t back down in trade war with US  commerce minister        SCMP Amanda Lee        China will not cave in to US demands even if it faces further tariffs on its exports  China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan has said  signalling Beijing’s uncompromising stance in dealing with US.         There is a view in the US that so long as the US keeps increasing tariffs  China will back down. They don’t know the history and culture of China   Zhong said  in a statement published by Bloomberg News.         This unyielding nation suffered foreign bullying for many times in history  but never succumbed to it even in the most difficult conditions. China doesn’t want a trade war  but would rise up to it should it break out.         The US should not underestimate China’s resolve and will.             This is Beijing’s strongest response yet to the trade war following a release of a white paper last month detailing its stance on the trade war  in which China blamed the US for creating the tensions and painted itself as a promoter of free trade.        The strong comments from Zhong  whose ministry is in the front line of any possible talks with the US  coincide with a rapid deterioration in the ties between Beijing and Washington.        Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage ofCHINA’S COMMERCE MINISTER ZHONG SHAN    US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  on a brief visit to Beijing on Monday  had a testy exchange with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.        Wang told Pompeo the US had hurt  mutual trust  and must stop  misguided actions  against China  while Pompeo said there were  fundamental disagreements  between the two powers.        Prospects for Beijing and Washington to de-escalate their trade tensions are not bright.        The two sides have locked horns in levying punitive tariffs against each other and there are gaping differences over a slew of issues from intellectual property rights to the role of state-owned enterprises.            The US initially imposed a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion worth of Chinese imports  and in September added a 10 per cent tariff on an additional US$200 billion of Chinese products  with the tariff rate set to rise to 25 per cent on January 1 if China does not make trade concessions.        China’s central bank to pump US$110 billion into economy as US trade war intensifies    US President Donald Trump has also threatened to extend punitive tariffs to all Chinese imports.        China retaliated with a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion of US imports and variable tariffs of 5 per cent to 10 per cent on a further US$60 billion of US imports.        China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi  left  and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a testy exchange on Monday in Beijing. Photo  AP    Washington is demanding China change its trade practices of forcing US businesses to transfer technologies and of subsidising state-owned enterprises.        Zhong reiterated Beijing’s line that China does not steal technology from US firms.         I want to emphasise that China’s laws and regulations do not contain any requirement for technology transfer and that companies’ purchases of technologies and patents are pure market behaviour   he said.         China’s economic development  and science and technological progress are owed to reform and opening up and the endeavours of the Chinese people.         As US turns up heat on China  trade war moves beyond tariffs to new battlefronts    Zhong also argued that China never  took advantage of the US  even as the country ran a record trade surplus of US$31.05 billion with the US in August.         If one side had been taken advantage of all the time  could such business relations have continued? Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage of   Zhong said.        The conflict between the two countries has now gone beyond trade  with Trump’s accusations that China is attempting to interfere in the 2018 US midterm congressional elections. Vice-President Mike Pence also stepped up the attack by condemning Beijing for using  every tool at its disposal  to undermine the US political system.        Pence also warned American companies  including tech giant Alphabet  which owns Google  to disengage from China.Trump rips up the trade playbook to take on China        Donna Borak  CNN        Updated 1037 GMT  1837 HKT  October 9  2018        Bali  Indonesia  CNN President Donald Trump wants a deal with China — just not anytime soon.        After announcing a revamped trade agreement with Canada and Mexico last week  Trump reeled off a list of other countries that he said had given in to US demands to hold talks or make a deal  South Korea  Japan  the European Union.    He scoffed at those  babies out there  who worried about the effects of tariffs  suggesting that  we wouldn  t be talking about a deal  with Canada and Mexico without his confrontational approach.    The trade war will hit US and Chinese growth next year  the IMF warns     That  s going to embolden him to impose more tariffs and threaten more in the hopes of getting a better deal out of China   said Edward Alden  a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.    Trump s no-holds-barred strategy on China is likely take center stage this week at a summit of global finance chiefs and central bankers in Bali  Indonesia. And it ll be up to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  the president s top economic envoy  to argue the US case as warnings intensify about the damage a protracted trade war could do to global economic growth.     The stakes are high   Christine Lagarde  the managing director of the International Monetary Fund  said last week.  We need to work together to de-escalate and resolve the current trade disputes.      Coalition of the willing     If the Trump administration can get the European Union and Japan on side following the recent trade deals with South Korea  Canada and Mexico  that s likely to strengthen the US negotiating position with Beijing  top administration officials argue.    US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA        US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA 01 58     We are talking to the European Union again  we are talking to Japan again  and we are moving to what I have characterized as a trade coalition of the willing to confront China   Larry Kudlow  Trump  s chief economic adviser  said last week.    But talks with Europe and Japan are still in the early stages. And French President Emmanuel Macron said last month that Europe shouldn t sign trade deals with any country that doesn t comply with the Paris Agreement on climate change  a clear reference to the United States.    The Trump administration s approach to building a coalition against Beijing is a break from the old playbook of working collaboratively with allies to address mutual concerns.    Other big economies like the European Union and Japan share some of the main US grievances with China  including intellectual property theft and pressure on foreign companies to hand over technology to Chinese partners. But Trump slapped tariffs on key allies at the same time as stepping up his campaign against China  which some analysts suggest has weakened any potential united front.    The Trump administration has imposed new tariffs on about half of China&#39;s annual goods exports to the United States.    Souring relationship    Trump has made clear he s in no rush to restart talks with Beijing anytime soon. Instead  he has threatened to impose an even bigger wave of tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese products. That would mean the US measures effectively cover all the goods China sells to the United States each year.     I  m using them to negotiate   Trump said of the tariffs.  And hopefully  we can make a great deal with China — a fair deal and a reciprocal deal.     Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Details of the revised pact with Canada and Mexico  which is set to replace NAFTA  show that the US government is also trying other ways to amplify the pressure on China.    Tucked in the new agreement is a requirement that each country inform the others if it wants to start free trade negotiations with a  non-market economy   a clear reference to China. The other countries would also be able to review any potential free trade deal with China.    That move has upset Beijing  further souring the relationship between the two economic superpowers.    In a frank exchange of views in Beijing on Monday  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the United States should immediately stop its  wrong remarks and actions   including the trade war. Pompeo responded that the two countries have a  fundamental disagreement  and that the United States has  great concerns about actions that China has taken.      How much pain are they willing to endure?     Neither side is showing signs of backing down.    The United States  whose economy relies less on exports than China s  is faring better so far. China s economy had already started slowing down this year and its stock markets and currency have slumped as the trade conflict has escalated.    China is pumping more cash into its economy as the trade war heats up     The question is  How much pain are they willing to endure?  said Thomas Bernes  a distinguished fellow for the Centre for International Governance Innovation.  They will be looking to the midterm elections to see if there is going to be a rejection of Trumpism or whether they he gains strength and remains in power.     For its part  the Trump administration appears willing to maintain the pressure for as long as it can.     We have changed the paradigm   US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said last month.  We have tariffs in place  and the president is not going to let this go along when you have forced transfer of intellectual property.     Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires at the end of November.    But with Beijing unwilling to give ground on US demands that it change fundamental parts of its economic policy  the prospects of reaching a deal anytime soon appear slim.     It is still hard to see how a further escalation of the trade conflict with China will be avoided   Andrew Hunter  US economist at research firm Capital Economics said in a note to clients last week.Is China or Russia America’s Defining Rival?    The debate doesn’t just have consequences for U.S. foreign policy—it will define the next decades of domestic affairs as well.        OCT 9  2018        Late last week  as most of America’s political class was transfixed by the denouement of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle  Vice President Mike Pence gave a wide-ranging address on the U.S. relationship with China  and why the Trump administration is committed to opposing its expansionist designs. For the most part  it was a familiar litany of complaints about China’s efforts to coerce its neighbors in the western Pacific  its trade abuses  its hostility to religious freedom  and its support of unsavory regimes around the world. Yet halfway through his remarks  the vice president shifted his emphasis  turning from all the various ways the Chinese party-state was acting in the world outside America’s borders to how it was seeking to influence political and cultural life inside them.        Specifically  Pence warned that  China wants a different American president   and that Beijing was mobilizing  covert actors  front groups  and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policies  to that end. By now  it has become routine for the heads of U.S. multinationals to condemn the Trump administration’s trade policies  and the fact that they’d do so is perfectly understandable. China’s violent labor repression and its policy of subsidizing industrialists at the expense of households have proved highly advantageous to those seeking a disciplined and relatively low-cost workforce  regardless of their citizenship. According to Pence  however  there is another layer to the politics of trade  namely that senior Chinese officials are threatening to punish business leaders who fail to denounce U.S. tariffs. He pointed to the rising sophistication with which Beijing exploits America’s domestic political cleavages  as evidenced by its targeting of retaliatory tariffs to regions and industries believed crucial to the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections  and its shrewd efforts to silence criticism of Chinese policies on university campuses desperate for Chinese money.

The implicit question raised by both Pence and Trump is this  Should we be more worried about Chinese meddling than Russian meddling? Some observers have dismissed the idea  warning that it represents a distraction from ongoing Russian meddling. Others acknowledge that while China’s efforts to influence democratic outcomes are different in character from Russia’s approach  which Beijing seems to see as  ineffective and counterproductive   there is no question that  as Rush Doshi and Robert D. Williams of the Brookings Institution have cautiously observed   China has long pursued a wide-ranging and very real campaign to influence the political and informational environment of other countries  including the United States.         Needless to say  one could see both Russia and China as dangerous rivals  and I certainly do. But in an age of intensifying partisan enmity  when large numbers of Americans question the legitimacy of the Trump presidency while similarly large numbers see Donald Trump as their champion  it is fitting that Democrats and Republicans can’t bring themselves to agree on which of the world’s revanchist powers ought to serve as what you might call our orienting enemy or  as the Harvard political scientist Samuel P. Huntington once put it  the  other  that gives our grand strategy its ideological shape.        In 1997  not long after the collapse of the Soviet bloc  Huntington warned that American grand strategy was losing its coherence in part because America’s creedal identity had long been defined in opposition to just such an  other.  In the early days of the republic  he observed  it was Britain that offered this necessary contrast  While the British lived under tyranny and hierarchy  Americans told themselves  we enjoyed freedom and equality. So  too  in later years did Wilhelmine Germany provide an orienting rivalry  and then the Nazi and Soviet totalitarianisms that ravaged the world for much of the 20th century. The Soviet Union’s demise therefore prompted a kind of identity crisis.  While wars at times may have a divisive effect on society   wrote Huntington   a common enemy can often help to promote identity and cohesion among people. The weakening or absence of a common enemy can do just the reverse.         What Huntington did not quite anticipate is that America would find itself divided between two creedal identities—one right  one left—each of which defines itself against a different enemy. This is a pattern that has obtained in earlier eras. Consider that the founding generation was bitterly divided over whether Revolutionary France or the British Empire represented the greater threat to American liberty. The early 1900s saw debates between Germanophiles  many of whom were progressives and socialists of German extraction  and Anglophiles who embraced the idea of a world order jointly administered by a British-American condominium. The difference now is that even in the supposed twilight of American global leadership  our creedal clashes reverberate around the world.        And so the United States finds itself in the midst of not one but two cold wars. To cosmopolitan liberals  it is Russia that serves as America’s chief geopolitical adversary. Even in Russia’s weakened and impoverished state  they fear the deftness with which its operatives act in connivance with illiberal elements in the world’s diverse market democracies to undermine them from within. Nationalist conservatives see rising Chinese power as the far graver threat to American interests  and they are increasingly open to wielding the power of the state to resist and counter Beijing’s depredations  despite the cost to economic freedom that may well result.        It is not difficult to understand why Russia has such a hold on the liberal imagination. There is at this point little doubt that the Russian state has sought to sow chaos and division in the U.S. and democratic Europe  in part out of a conviction that Western liberals have done much the same throughout post-Soviet Eurasia. Though the extent to which Russian information operations influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election is contested  the notion that it played a decisive role is an article of faith among Trump’s liberal critics  for whom Vladimir Putin is the perfect foil.        The Putin ascendancy has been defined by  in the first place  rank kleptocracy  but also by an explicit and often deranged antiliberalism  in which the chief enemies of the Russian nation are the forces of gay rights and feminism. As the American author Timothy Snyder has argued  Putinism’s crusade against gay rights was designed  to transform demands for democracy into a nebulous threat to Russian innocence  voting = west = sodomy.  While defining liberalism as the politics of sexual perversion  Putin defines his own regime as the defender of masculinity and traditionalism  and as the natural ally of all those who defend state sovereignty against the supposed cosmopolitan conspiracy to dissolve the natural family. In short  Putin invites cosmopolitan liberals to see Russia under his rule as their enemy  just as he invites right-wing populists in the Western democracies to see him as a friend.        An America that defines itself against Putin’s Russia is an America that would redouble its commitment to cosmopolitan liberalism  including a commitment to free and open trade on a multilateral  nondiscriminatory basis  while marginalizing nationalist conservatism as retrograde. nato would be shored up  which is all to the good  but the U.S. would adopt a warier attitude toward populist parties in Central and Eastern Europe  a stance that could see these democracies drift further out of the American orbit.        And as for the Chinese party-state  it wouldn’t exactly be a friend  especially in light of its hostility to civil liberties  but the Chinese Communist Party’s stated commitment to combating climate change and antitrade nationalist politicians would lend it a certain prestige and legitimacy. Shortly after Trump’s inauguration  Xi Jinping presented himself as a defender of a rules-based international order  the Paris agreement  and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran  and in doing so he won himself admirers in elite circles  especially among those unaware of the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims for political crimes. Over time  a U.S. grand strategy rooted in cosmopolitan liberalism might grow warier of Chinese power  especially if the Chinese party-state were to become more explicitly nationalist as it sees less of a need to cater to cosmopolitan-liberal sensibilities  as seems likely. But by then the economic integration of the Western democracies with China might be irreversible  and Beijing would have the upper hand.        What would it mean for the U.S. to instead choose China as its  other   as nationalist conservatives would have it? One early indication comes from a recent report from the Department of Defense  which details America’s growing dependence on China’s manufacturing base  and the threat this poses to the country’s war-fighting capabilities. In the 1990s and 2000s  market conservatives could point to the Soviet collapse as an indictment of statism  and to global economic integration as an unambiguous good. Many of these market conservatives now find themselves making common cause with cosmopolitan liberals while nationalist conservatives rethink their commitment to laissez-faire  with an eye toward meeting the challenge posed by a Chinese party-state that sees industrial progress as central to its strategic ambitions. If Beijing  not Moscow  is public enemy No. 1  it is vital that the U.S. boost public investment in infrastructure and human capital  and that it steer U.S. firms to build resilient supply chains based in the Americas  not in China’s industrial heartland. Russia would still be a rival  I suspect  but it would be seen through a different lens  as a potential ally in the protracted conflict with China  as would become much clearer once Putin himself exits the scene.        Culturally  choosing China as an orienting enemy would have more ambiguous effects. One can imagine a xenophobic turn against Chinese immigrants  visitors  and students  which would have ugly consequences. Yet one can also imagine an embrace of the Chinese people on the grounds that Beijing’s authoritarianism serves a narrow elite more than it serves ordinary workers. The argument  in essence  would be that the U.S. stands against the party-state  not China as a whole  and that America would welcome a more just and inclusive Chinese government. Indeed  Pence made exactly this argument in his recent address. More broadly  an America waging a cold war on China might place a somewhat greater emphasis on cohesion and solidarity over cosmopolitanism  not least because disentangling the American and Chinese economies would entail considerable sacrifice on the part of the U.S. business elite—a sacrifice that would have to be justified in solidaristic terms.        Which enemy will we choose in the years to come? Which cold war will we wage most assiduously? The answer will depend in no small part on the outcome of the elections to come. If history is any guide  the stakes are high  and the consequences will be enduring.Chinese Media Vow to Fight Against  Insult’ from Pence  Threaten  Cold War’        8 Oct 2018        China’s state-run Global Times vowed over the weekend to fight back against  insults  from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and promised a  new Cold War  if the Trump administration forces the issue by continuing to produce  hostile reports and speeches.     The Global Times took a passive-aggressive approach in an editorial on Sunday  beginning with strong criticism of Pence’s speech at the Hudson Institute last Thursday and citing observers who compared it to Sir Winston Churchill’s  Iron Curtain  speech about the Soviet Union at the dawn of the Cold War.        The editorial soon mellowed into a reflection on high points of the relationship between America and China  such as U.S. President Richard Nixon’s opening to China  and even took some credit for helping President Ronald Reagan put the Soviet Union out of business.        The Global Times then reiterated Beijing’s standard line about how soft  democratic America stands no chance against authoritarian China in a trade war and positioned Beijing as the more mature player in a conflict Washington has not yet realized it cannot win         The US  in fact  has limited leverage to contain China. A trade war will inevitably damage the US and is a stupid choice. It’s unrealistic to establish a NATO-style organization to target China. It is impossible to isolate and contain China given its expanding business overseas and domestic markets.        It’s difficult for the White House and Congress to mobilize an anti-China campaign in US society. Gone are the days when the public was willing to take a plunge for the so-called national interest. As long as China keeps calm in the face of hysterical US political elites  the so-called Cold War will not take shape.        At such a time  China should play tai chi with the US. This is the unique strategic wisdom of the Chinese nation. We must make the US feel the pain of the trade war and not allow the US to act unscrupulously in the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits. But we must act in a calm way. China will continue to open up. A deteriorating outside world will not change that.        China is not the Soviet Union. The US cannot deal with China as it did with the Soviet Union.        That last line became a Chinese political mantra with blinding speed after Pence’s speech to the Hudson Institute was compared to Churchill’s Iron Curtain speech.        On Monday  the Global Times pronounced China hurt and confused by the  stinging  speech Pence delivered to the Hudson Institute  filled with accusations that were  vitriolic  ruthless  and delivered in terms considered far from decorous.         This second editorial invoked the  Thucydides Trap   which has become another common talking point for Chinese politicians. The Thucydides Trap is a theory that posits ruling powers almost always go to war with rising powers  usually to the regret of both nations  unless extraordinary efforts are made to avoid conflict.        Beijing’s interpretation of Thucydides is that America has a unique responsibility to welcome China as a new global superpower and refrain from protecting American dominance by attempting to  contain  China.        As far as the Chinese are concerned  they are already doing everything a rising power could possibly do to ameliorate the concerns of the aging world hegemon  and they cannot understand why the Trump administration suddenly decided to make a  U-turn  at the urging of  hardliners  and commence efforts to contain China.        The Global Times defended the ad China took out in the Des Moines Register in September  widely seen as a major reason for the Trump administration’s complaint about Chinese interference in U.S. elections.         Where is the U.S.’ long-hailed freedom of the press?  a state-run newspaper from one of the world’s most aggressive authoritarian regimes risibly asked. In a similar vein  the Global Times portrayed China as merely seeking to defend itself from a  U.S.-initiated trade war   as if China has not been manipulating markets and stealing technology for decades.        The Global Times concluded President Trump is beating up on China to goose Republican turnout for the midterm elections and distract from  the Russiagate scandal          The reason that the Trump administration deliberately chose this timing – when China-US trade tensions are ratcheting up – to deliver the inflammatory speech is the upcoming US midterm elections.        Trump knows that playing the China card is always the safest option. It cannot only divert domestic attention from the Russiagate scandal and shift the political pressure from the president but also incite ordinary voters.        These unfounded accusations show that the understanding and judgment of the Trump administration on Sino-US relations are unprofessional  shallow and indiscreet  which is most worrying. The worsening atmosphere toward China in the US not only affects American public’ opinion on the country but also endangers the safety and interests of Chinese in the US.        When the leader of a state accuses other countries at will  how can he justify his reputation to improve bilateral ties? Perhaps the Trump government needs to think about how to show respect to China before requesting China to respect the US.        The Chinese appear to know the American left is very receptive to theories that President Trump relies on populist appeals to xenophobia and is desperate to distract from the investigation into  Russian collusion  in the 2016 election. Utterly messed up my life   What Chinese people really think of the trade war        The Guardian By Echo HuangOctober 9  2018        China’s ardent determination to win the trade war might not have all the public support it would like.        Since the US and China entered a trade war in earnest this year  both sides have been going tit-for-tat with increasing tariffs on goods. The US has put new tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports  while China has done the same to $110 billion worth of US goods. And while China’s running out of US goods to keep the retaliation going  its strongest weapon in this  war of national fate  with the US is the spirit of the Chinese people  according to state media.         The heroism of  being the first to show concern and the last to enjoy oneself’ has always run through Chinese blood  which also includes the spirit of  sacrificing one’s interest for the greater good of the public    said an opinion piece  link in Chinese  posted by the state-run People’s Daily on July 10.  Facing this  war of national fate ’ Chinese are deeply aware that  there’s no home without a country ’ so they are willing to bear temporary losses.         That comment doesn’t acknowledge how painful the trade war could become for common people. Economists estimate that if the latest Chinese goods to be added to the trade war see tariffs go up to 25% next year  it could shave half a percentage point off China’s growth. Online  people are sharing how they’re experiencing the impacts so far  and worrying about what’s to come.        Stocks tumble  yuan devalues    On Monday  Oct.7   the first day after the Golden Week holiday  Chinese stocks fell sharply. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 3.7%—its biggest single-day loss  paywall   in more than three months. The stock tumble came a day after China’s central bank announced that it would cut the reserve requirement ratio for commercial banks for the fourth time this year—a move seen as trying to boost the economy by increasing liquidity amid the trade war. In general  China’s stock markets haven’t been  paywall  taking the trade war in stride.         This has been a tough year for me. I haven’t received payments on several projects because of stock bursts   wrote a user  link in Chinese  of social media platform Weibo  who identified himself as working at a securities firm in Beijing.  The stock market’s tumble and the trade war have killed many projects. When I returned home  the village officials asked me how’s my work so far this year. My answer  sadly  was this—deleveraging  bad stock performance  and the trade war have utterly messed up my life.         REUTERS/MARIANA BAZO    Looking for new markets.    The devalued yuan has also worried many. While it could help exporters by making their goods more competitive  it makes life tougher for people who need foreign currency  for example families of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese studying abroad.         We are now kneeling to the trade war. It’s hard to see that the RMB [renminbi] can be stable in the near term. Looks like the Great Depression is going to arrive   said a Weibo comment  link in Chinese .        Snacks  oil prices up    Treats are suddenly more expensive due to tariffs  and so are daily necessities.         I ran out of nuts yesterday and wanted to top up my stock   wrote a female user  link in Chinese  based in northern Hebei province  but she found the nuts she’s used to eating every day  including pecans  commonly sourced from the US  cost her more.         I asked the shop owner   Why is it more expensive than last time?’ The owner said it’s because of the trade war   she continued   And I asked him   What’s the relationship?’ He said that he had imported lots of the nuts from overseas. This is the first time I feel the impact of the trade war.         As for Maine lobster  forget about it.        Chinese drivers are also feeling the pinch  with China putting tariffs on US oil imports in August.         I’ve deeply felt that the economic environment is not good. This year  there’s peer-to-peer lending and illegal money-raising crackdown  which also bled out a bunch of people. Now the drop has come to the real estate market…. then there’s the trade war  and oil prices keep going up. It won’t be long before I can’t afford to run my car   wrote a user  link in Chinese .        Small businesses may be harder hit than larger ones. The most recent Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index  a better gauge of sentiment at smaller  private firms than the official manufacturing PMI  declined from 50.6 in August to 50 last month  the lowest level in more than a year. A number below 50 indicates a contraction.        REUTERS    In response to US tariffs  China has put tariffs on American soybean imports.    Pessimism about the new NAFTA    People aren’t optimistic the pressure on China’s economy will ease up. In fact  the new North American Free Trade Agreement renegotiated by the US  Mexico  and Canada—now with a brand-new acronym—shows the formation of a front against China  some online commenters noted.         Why is the Chinese economy going to be difficult in the next six months?  wrote a male user  link in Chinese  of micro-blogging site Weibo  based in China’s southwestern Sichuan province. His argument that the elements that have been key to driving China’s economic growth in recent years—including infrastructure  foreign trade  and domestic demands—have all shown worrying signs.          In terms of foreign trade  this is the most worrying   he wrote.  The Americans are launching trade wars worldwide because they want to bypass the WTO [World Trade Organization] and build something new. At the end of September  the US  Canada and Mexico signed a new cooperation agreement. The agreement said if a  non-market-oriented economy  wants to enter their market  it needs the approval of all the three countries… Everyone knows who this  non-market-oriented economy’ is.          The new NAFTA asks countries in the agreement to notify each other if they are to have trade deal talks with a  non-market  economy  and also give one another a say in the deal.          Americans have been building an anti-China circle. In the first round  the Mexico gave in  then Canada. I am afraid that the third round is Japan  then Europe   said another  link in Chinese .  I highly suggest that China should make major adjustments to its current policies instead of listening to the opinions from so-called elites. China won’t back down in trade war with US  commerce minister        SCMP Amanda Lee        China will not cave in to US demands even if it faces further tariffs on its exports  China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan has said  signalling Beijing’s uncompromising stance in dealing with US.         There is a view in the US that so long as the US keeps increasing tariffs  China will back down. They don’t know the history and culture of China   Zhong said  in a statement published by Bloomberg News.         This unyielding nation suffered foreign bullying for many times in history  but never succumbed to it even in the most difficult conditions. China doesn’t want a trade war  but would rise up to it should it break out.         The US should not underestimate China’s resolve and will.             This is Beijing’s strongest response yet to the trade war following a release of a white paper last month detailing its stance on the trade war  in which China blamed the US for creating the tensions and painted itself as a promoter of free trade.        The strong comments from Zhong  whose ministry is in the front line of any possible talks with the US  coincide with a rapid deterioration in the ties between Beijing and Washington.        Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage ofCHINA’S COMMERCE MINISTER ZHONG SHAN    US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  on a brief visit to Beijing on Monday  had a testy exchange with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.        Wang told Pompeo the US had hurt  mutual trust  and must stop  misguided actions  against China  while Pompeo said there were  fundamental disagreements  between the two powers.        Prospects for Beijing and Washington to de-escalate their trade tensions are not bright.        The two sides have locked horns in levying punitive tariffs against each other and there are gaping differences over a slew of issues from intellectual property rights to the role of state-owned enterprises.            The US initially imposed a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion worth of Chinese imports  and in September added a 10 per cent tariff on an additional US$200 billion of Chinese products  with the tariff rate set to rise to 25 per cent on January 1 if China does not make trade concessions.        China’s central bank to pump US$110 billion into economy as US trade war intensifies    US President Donald Trump has also threatened to extend punitive tariffs to all Chinese imports.        China retaliated with a 25 per cent tariff on US$50 billion of US imports and variable tariffs of 5 per cent to 10 per cent on a further US$60 billion of US imports.        China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi  left  and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a testy exchange on Monday in Beijing. Photo  AP    Washington is demanding China change its trade practices of forcing US businesses to transfer technologies and of subsidising state-owned enterprises.        Zhong reiterated Beijing’s line that China does not steal technology from US firms.         I want to emphasise that China’s laws and regulations do not contain any requirement for technology transfer and that companies’ purchases of technologies and patents are pure market behaviour   he said.         China’s economic development  and science and technological progress are owed to reform and opening up and the endeavours of the Chinese people.         As US turns up heat on China  trade war moves beyond tariffs to new battlefronts    Zhong also argued that China never  took advantage of the US  even as the country ran a record trade surplus of US$31.05 billion with the US in August.         If one side had been taken advantage of all the time  could such business relations have continued? Companies and consumers know best whether or not they have been taken advantage of   Zhong said.        The conflict between the two countries has now gone beyond trade  with Trump’s accusations that China is attempting to interfere in the 2018 US midterm congressional elections. Vice-President Mike Pence also stepped up the attack by condemning Beijing for using  every tool at its disposal  to undermine the US political system.        Pence also warned American companies  including tech giant Alphabet  which owns Google  to disengage from China.Trump rips up the trade playbook to take on China        Donna Borak  CNN        Updated 1037 GMT  1837 HKT  October 9  2018        Bali  Indonesia  CNN President Donald Trump wants a deal with China — just not anytime soon.        After announcing a revamped trade agreement with Canada and Mexico last week  Trump reeled off a list of other countries that he said had given in to US demands to hold talks or make a deal  South Korea  Japan  the European Union.    He scoffed at those  babies out there  who worried about the effects of tariffs  suggesting that  we wouldn  t be talking about a deal  with Canada and Mexico without his confrontational approach.    The trade war will hit US and Chinese growth next year  the IMF warns     That  s going to embolden him to impose more tariffs and threaten more in the hopes of getting a better deal out of China   said Edward Alden  a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.    Trump s no-holds-barred strategy on China is likely take center stage this week at a summit of global finance chiefs and central bankers in Bali  Indonesia. And it ll be up to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  the president s top economic envoy  to argue the US case as warnings intensify about the damage a protracted trade war could do to global economic growth.     The stakes are high   Christine Lagarde  the managing director of the International Monetary Fund  said last week.  We need to work together to de-escalate and resolve the current trade disputes.      Coalition of the willing     If the Trump administration can get the European Union and Japan on side following the recent trade deals with South Korea  Canada and Mexico  that s likely to strengthen the US negotiating position with Beijing  top administration officials argue.    US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA        US and Canada reach deal on NAFTA 01 58     We are talking to the European Union again  we are talking to Japan again  and we are moving to what I have characterized as a trade coalition of the willing to confront China   Larry Kudlow  Trump  s chief economic adviser  said last week.    But talks with Europe and Japan are still in the early stages. And French President Emmanuel Macron said last month that Europe shouldn t sign trade deals with any country that doesn t comply with the Paris Agreement on climate change  a clear reference to the United States.    The Trump administration s approach to building a coalition against Beijing is a break from the old playbook of working collaboratively with allies to address mutual concerns.    Other big economies like the European Union and Japan share some of the main US grievances with China  including intellectual property theft and pressure on foreign companies to hand over technology to Chinese partners. But Trump slapped tariffs on key allies at the same time as stepping up his campaign against China  which some analysts suggest has weakened any potential united front.    The Trump administration has imposed new tariffs on about half of China&#39;s annual goods exports to the United States.    Souring relationship    Trump has made clear he s in no rush to restart talks with Beijing anytime soon. Instead  he has threatened to impose an even bigger wave of tariffs on another $267 billion of Chinese products. That would mean the US measures effectively cover all the goods China sells to the United States each year.     I  m using them to negotiate   Trump said of the tariffs.  And hopefully  we can make a great deal with China — a fair deal and a reciprocal deal.     Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Trade war looms over summit of global finance chiefs    Details of the revised pact with Canada and Mexico  which is set to replace NAFTA  show that the US government is also trying other ways to amplify the pressure on China.    Tucked in the new agreement is a requirement that each country inform the others if it wants to start free trade negotiations with a  non-market economy   a clear reference to China. The other countries would also be able to review any potential free trade deal with China.    That move has upset Beijing  further souring the relationship between the two economic superpowers.    In a frank exchange of views in Beijing on Monday  Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the United States should immediately stop its  wrong remarks and actions   including the trade war. Pompeo responded that the two countries have a  fundamental disagreement  and that the United States has  great concerns about actions that China has taken.      How much pain are they willing to endure?     Neither side is showing signs of backing down.    The United States  whose economy relies less on exports than China s  is faring better so far. China s economy had already started slowing down this year and its stock markets and currency have slumped as the trade conflict has escalated.    China is pumping more cash into its economy as the trade war heats up     The question is  How much pain are they willing to endure?  said Thomas Bernes  a distinguished fellow for the Centre for International Governance Innovation.  They will be looking to the midterm elections to see if there is going to be a rejection of Trumpism or whether they he gains strength and remains in power.     For its part  the Trump administration appears willing to maintain the pressure for as long as it can.     We have changed the paradigm   US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said last month.  We have tariffs in place  and the president is not going to let this go along when you have forced transfer of intellectual property.     Trump is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires at the end of November.    But with Beijing unwilling to give ground on US demands that it change fundamental parts of its economic policy  the prospects of reaching a deal anytime soon appear slim.     It is still hard to see how a further escalation of the trade conflict with China will be avoided   Andrew Hunter  US economist at research firm Capital Economics said in a note to clients last week.Is China or Russia America’s Defining Rival?    The debate doesn’t just have consequences for U.S. foreign policy—it will define the next decades of domestic affairs as well.        OCT 9  2018        Late last week  as most of America’s political class was transfixed by the denouement of the Kavanaugh confirmation battle  Vice President Mike Pence gave a wide-ranging address on the U.S. relationship with China  and why the Trump administration is committed to opposing its expansionist designs. For the most part  it was a familiar litany of complaints about China’s efforts to coerce its neighbors in the western Pacific  its trade abuses  its hostility to religious freedom  and its support of unsavory regimes around the world. Yet halfway through his remarks  the vice president shifted his emphasis  turning from all the various ways the Chinese party-state was acting in the world outside America’s borders to how it was seeking to influence political and cultural life inside them.        Specifically  Pence warned that  China wants a different American president   and that Beijing was mobilizing  covert actors  front groups  and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policies  to that end. By now  it has become routine for the heads of U.S. multinationals to condemn the Trump administration’s trade policies  and the fact that they’d do so is perfectly understandable. China’s violent labor repression and its policy of subsidizing industrialists at the expense of households have proved highly advantageous to those seeking a disciplined and relatively low-cost workforce  regardless of their citizenship. According to Pence  however  there is another layer to the politics of trade  namely that senior Chinese officials are threatening to punish business leaders who fail to denounce U.S. tariffs. He pointed to the rising sophistication with which Beijing exploits America’s domestic political cleavages  as evidenced by its targeting of retaliatory tariffs to regions and industries believed crucial to the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections  and its shrewd efforts to silence criticism of Chinese policies on university campuses desperate for Chinese money.

The implicit question raised by both Pence and Trump is this  Should we be more worried about Chinese meddling than Russian meddling? Some observers have dismissed the idea  warning that it represents a distraction from ongoing Russian meddling. Others acknowledge that while China’s efforts to influence democratic outcomes are different in character from Russia’s approach  which Beijing seems to see as  ineffective and counterproductive   there is no question that  as Rush Doshi and Robert D. Williams of the Brookings Institution have cautiously observed   China has long pursued a wide-ranging and very real campaign to influence the political and informational environment of other countries  including the United States.         Needless to say  one could see both Russia and China as dangerous rivals  and I certainly do. But in an age of intensifying partisan enmity  when large numbers of Americans question the legitimacy of the Trump presidency while similarly large numbers see Donald Trump as their champion  it is fitting that Democrats and Republicans can’t bring themselves to agree on which of the world’s revanchist powers ought to serve as what you might call our orienting enemy or  as the Harvard political scientist Samuel P. Huntington once put it  the  other  that gives our grand strategy its ideological shape.        In 1997  not long after the collapse of the Soviet bloc  Huntington warned that American grand strategy was losing its coherence in part because America’s creedal identity had long been defined in opposition to just such an  other.  In the early days of the republic  he observed  it was Britain that offered this necessary contrast  While the British lived under tyranny and hierarchy  Americans told themselves  we enjoyed freedom and equality. So  too  in later years did Wilhelmine Germany provide an orienting rivalry  and then the Nazi and Soviet totalitarianisms that ravaged the world for much of the 20th century. The Soviet Union’s demise therefore prompted a kind of identity crisis.  While wars at times may have a divisive effect on society   wrote Huntington   a common enemy can often help to promote identity and cohesion among people. The weakening or absence of a common enemy can do just the reverse.         What Huntington did not quite anticipate is that America would find itself divided between two creedal identities—one right  one left—each of which defines itself against a different enemy. This is a pattern that has obtained in earlier eras. Consider that the founding generation was bitterly divided over whether Revolutionary France or the British Empire represented the greater threat to American liberty. The early 1900s saw debates between Germanophiles  many of whom were progressives and socialists of German extraction  and Anglophiles who embraced the idea of a world order jointly administered by a British-American condominium. The difference now is that even in the supposed twilight of American global leadership  our creedal clashes reverberate around the world.        And so the United States finds itself in the midst of not one but two cold wars. To cosmopolitan liberals  it is Russia that serves as America’s chief geopolitical adversary. Even in Russia’s weakened and impoverished state  they fear the deftness with which its operatives act in connivance with illiberal elements in the world’s diverse market democracies to undermine them from within. Nationalist conservatives see rising Chinese power as the far graver threat to American interests  and they are increasingly open to wielding the power of the state to resist and counter Beijing’s depredations  despite the cost to economic freedom that may well result.        It is not difficult to understand why Russia has such a hold on the liberal imagination. There is at this point little doubt that the Russian state has sought to sow chaos and division in the U.S. and democratic Europe  in part out of a conviction that Western liberals have done much the same throughout post-Soviet Eurasia. Though the extent to which Russian information operations influenced the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election is contested  the notion that it played a decisive role is an article of faith among Trump’s liberal critics  for whom Vladimir Putin is the perfect foil.        The Putin ascendancy has been defined by  in the first place  rank kleptocracy  but also by an explicit and often deranged antiliberalism  in which the chief enemies of the Russian nation are the forces of gay rights and feminism. As the American author Timothy Snyder has argued  Putinism’s crusade against gay rights was designed  to transform demands for democracy into a nebulous threat to Russian innocence  voting = west = sodomy.  While defining liberalism as the politics of sexual perversion  Putin defines his own regime as the defender of masculinity and traditionalism  and as the natural ally of all those who defend state sovereignty against the supposed cosmopolitan conspiracy to dissolve the natural family. In short  Putin invites cosmopolitan liberals to see Russia under his rule as their enemy  just as he invites right-wing populists in the Western democracies to see him as a friend.        An America that defines itself against Putin’s Russia is an America that would redouble its commitment to cosmopolitan liberalism  including a commitment to free and open trade on a multilateral  nondiscriminatory basis  while marginalizing nationalist conservatism as retrograde. nato would be shored up  which is all to the good  but the U.S. would adopt a warier attitude toward populist parties in Central and Eastern Europe  a stance that could see these democracies drift further out of the American orbit.        And as for the Chinese party-state  it wouldn’t exactly be a friend  especially in light of its hostility to civil liberties  but the Chinese Communist Party’s stated commitment to combating climate change and antitrade nationalist politicians would lend it a certain prestige and legitimacy. Shortly after Trump’s inauguration  Xi Jinping presented himself as a defender of a rules-based international order  the Paris agreement  and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran  and in doing so he won himself admirers in elite circles  especially among those unaware of the imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims for political crimes. Over time  a U.S. grand strategy rooted in cosmopolitan liberalism might grow warier of Chinese power  especially if the Chinese party-state were to become more explicitly nationalist as it sees less of a need to cater to cosmopolitan-liberal sensibilities  as seems likely. But by then the economic integration of the Western democracies with China might be irreversible  and Beijing would have the upper hand.        What would it mean for the U.S. to instead choose China as its  other   as nationalist conservatives would have it? One early indication comes from a recent report from the Department of Defense  which details America’s growing dependence on China’s manufacturing base  and the threat this poses to the country’s war-fighting capabilities. In the 1990s and 2000s  market conservatives could point to the Soviet collapse as an indictment of statism  and to global economic integration as an unambiguous good. Many of these market conservatives now find themselves making common cause with cosmopolitan liberals while nationalist conservatives rethink their commitment to laissez-faire  with an eye toward meeting the challenge posed by a Chinese party-state that sees industrial progress as central to its strategic ambitions. If Beijing  not Moscow  is public enemy No. 1  it is vital that the U.S. boost public investment in infrastructure and human capital  and that it steer U.S. firms to build resilient supply chains based in the Americas  not in China’s industrial heartland. Russia would still be a rival  I suspect  but it would be seen through a different lens  as a potential ally in the protracted conflict with China  as would become much clearer once Putin himself exits the scene.        Culturally  choosing China as an orienting enemy would have more ambiguous effects. One can imagine a xenophobic turn against Chinese immigrants  visitors  and students  which would have ugly consequences. Yet one can also imagine an embrace of the Chinese people on the grounds that Beijing’s authoritarianism serves a narrow elite more than it serves ordinary workers. The argument  in essence  would be that the U.S. stands against the party-state  not China as a whole  and that America would welcome a more just and inclusive Chinese government. Indeed  Pence made exactly this argument in his recent address. More broadly  an America waging a cold war on China might place a somewhat greater emphasis on cohesion and solidarity over cosmopolitanism  not least because disentangling the American and Chinese economies would entail considerable sacrifice on the part of the U.S. business elite—a sacrifice that would have to be justified in solidaristic terms.        Which enemy will we choose in the years to come? Which cold war will we wage most assiduously? The answer will depend in no small part on the outcome of the elections to come. If history is any guide  the stakes are high  and the consequences will be enduring.Chinese Media Vow to Fight Against  Insult’ from Pence  Threaten  Cold War’        8 Oct 2018        China’s state-run Global Times vowed over the weekend to fight back against  insults  from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and promised a  new Cold War  if the Trump administration forces the issue by continuing to produce  hostile reports and speeches.     The Global Times took a passive-aggressive approach in an editorial on Sunday  beginning with strong criticism of Pence’s speech at the Hudson Institute last Thursday and citing observers who compared it to Sir Winston Churchill’s  Iron Curtain  speech about the Soviet Union at the dawn of the Cold War.        The editorial soon mellowed into a reflection on high points of the relationship between America and China  such as U.S. President Richard Nixon’s opening to China  and even took some credit for helping President Ronald Reagan put the Soviet Union out of business.        The Global Times then reiterated Beijing’s standard line about how soft  democratic America stands no chance against authoritarian China in a trade war and positioned Beijing as the more mature player in a conflict Washington has not yet realized it cannot win         The US  in fact  has limited leverage to contain China. A trade war will inevitably damage the US and is a stupid choice. It’s unrealistic to establish a NATO-style organization to target China. It is impossible to isolate and contain China given its expanding business overseas and domestic markets.        It’s difficult for the White House and Congress to mobilize an anti-China campaign in US society. Gone are the days when the public was willing to take a plunge for the so-called national interest. As long as China keeps calm in the face of hysterical US political elites  the so-called Cold War will not take shape.        At such a time  China should play tai chi with the US. This is the unique strategic wisdom of the Chinese nation. We must make the US feel the pain of the trade war and not allow the US to act unscrupulously in the South China Sea and Taiwan Straits. But we must act in a calm way. China will continue to open up. A deteriorating outside world will not change that.        China is not the Soviet Union. The US cannot deal with China as it did with the Soviet Union.        That last line became a Chinese political mantra with blinding speed after Pence’s speech to the Hudson Institute was compared to Churchill’s Iron Curtain speech.        On Monday  the Global Times pronounced China hurt and confused by the  stinging  speech Pence delivered to the Hudson Institute  filled with accusations that were  vitriolic  ruthless  and delivered in terms considered far from decorous.         This second editorial invoked the  Thucydides Trap   which has become another common talking point for Chinese politicians. The Thucydides Trap is a theory that posits ruling powers almost always go to war with rising powers  usually to the regret of both nations  unless extraordinary efforts are made to avoid conflict.        Beijing’s interpretation of Thucydides is that America has a unique responsibility to welcome China as a new global superpower and refrain from protecting American dominance by attempting to  contain  China.        As far as the Chinese are concerned  they are already doing everything a rising power could possibly do to ameliorate the concerns of the aging world hegemon  and they cannot understand why the Trump administration suddenly decided to make a  U-turn  at the urging of  hardliners  and commence efforts to contain China.        The Global Times defended the ad China took out in the Des Moines Register in September  widely seen as a major reason for the Trump administration’s complaint about Chinese interference in U.S. elections.         Where is the U.S.’ long-hailed freedom of the press?  a state-run newspaper from one of the world’s most aggressive authoritarian regimes risibly asked. In a similar vein  the Global Times portrayed China as merely seeking to defend itself from a  U.S.-initiated trade war   as if China has not been manipulating markets and stealing technology for decades.        The Global Times concluded President Trump is beating up on China to goose Republican turnout for the midterm elections and distract from  the Russiagate scandal          The reason that the Trump administration deliberately chose this timing – when China-US trade tensions are ratcheting up – to deliver the inflammatory speech is the upcoming US midterm elections.        Trump knows that playing the China card is always the safest option. It cannot only divert domestic attention from the Russiagate scandal and shift the political pressure from the president but also incite ordinary voters.        These unfounded accusations show that the understanding and judgment of the Trump administration on Sino-US relations are unprofessional  shallow and indiscreet  which is most worrying. The worsening atmosphere toward China in the US not only affects American public’ opinion on the country but also endangers the safety and interests of Chinese in the US.        When the leader of a state accuses other countries at will  how can he justify his reputation to improve bilateral ties? Perhaps the Trump government needs to think about how to show respect to China before requesting China to respect the US.        The Chinese appear to know the American left is very receptive to theories that President Trump relies on populist appeals to xenophobia and is desperate to distract from the investigation into  Russian collusion  in the 2016 election. ]'"
